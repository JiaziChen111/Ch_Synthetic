\section{Data}
\gototoc
\begin{todolist}
	\item After comparing datasets downloaded from BLP on Mar 2018 and Feb 2019: BLP updated values (slightly) in variables starting on: 9/30/2009 (USSW), 5/4/11 (USBC, USBA).
	\item EUBS1-EUBS20 for PLN deleted since already downloaded for HUF.
	\item Check PZSW*V3 Curncy against PZSW* Curncy for PLN because the former have a shorter history (became active in 2013 vs 2000). Why the substitution? Was it because PZSW* Curncy were discontinued?
	\item Download PZSW15 and Curncy PZSW20 to complement the history 6/12/2000-1/30/2013 for Curncy PZSW15V3 Curncy and PZSW20V3 Curncy, respectively.
	\item Check MRBS* starting in 4/20/2016 because in the data downloaded in 2019 they were flat most of the time after that date.
	\item Check the following series b/c they remain mostly flat during those periods: SABS15 Curncy b/w 4/15/2014-1/27/2016, SABS20 Curncy b/w 4/15/2014-8/28/2015, SABS25 Curncy b/w 1/3/2000-9/5/2011, SABS30 Curncy b/w 1/3/2000-5/10/2010.
	\item Check NOK: C26610Y Index is flat after Nov 2012, C26610Y is flat twice during the sample.
\end{todolist}

\section{Codes}
\begin{todolist}
	\item Update codes since EUBS1-EUBS20 for PLN was deleted because they were already downloaded for HUF.
	\item For PLN consider removing PZBSEC6 Curncy, PZBSEC8 Curncy, PZBSEC9 Curncy (and PZSW6V3 Curncy, PZSW8V3 Curncy, PZSW9V3 Curncy) because they start in 2011 and that seems to eliminate the data before 2011 for PLN even if it is available for all the other tenors; plus it may not be needed, it depends on the other variables in the formula having the 6Y tenor available. Or modify the code so that those tenors are considered once they become available (and discarded before 2011).
	\item Availability of data for PZBSEC6 Curncy and PZSW15 and Curncy might be related to the history of the synthetic curves for PLN.
	\item Check that the shorter history of PZSW15V3 Curncy and PZSW20V3 Curncy (starts in 2013) does not affect the history of the synthetic curves for PLN.
	\item Check that MRBS10 and lower start around 2005, while MRBS15 around 2007 and MRBS20 in mid-2009.
	\item RRUSSW10 and lower start in 2006, while RRUSSW15 and RRUSSW20 in 2009.
	\item TBSWNI10  and lower start in 2007, TBSWNI15 and TBSWNI20 in 2009.
