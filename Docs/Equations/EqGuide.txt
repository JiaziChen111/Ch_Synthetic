From Carroll's BufferStockTheory.tex

Create 'econtexShortcuts.sty' and save it in Library -> texmf -> tex -> latex
in BufferStockTheory.tex call it by including in the preamble 
'\usepackage{econtexShortcuts}'

The file 'econtexShortcuts.sty' uses \providecommand to define variables which are then used to write the equations.

What do newcommand, renewcommand, and providecommand do, and how do they differ?

Once it the equation with a label (e.g. \label{eq:supfn}) is saved in the Equations folder (up one level, i.e. at the level of the Latex folder), it is called in the main tex file using:

\input ../\eq/supfn.tex
