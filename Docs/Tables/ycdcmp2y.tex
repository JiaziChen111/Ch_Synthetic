						\tabnote{This table reports the estimated slope coefficients of panel data regressions of the 2-year nominal yields and their components on selected explanatory variables. The sample includes monthly data for 15 countries starting in 2000:1 and ending in 2019:12. The dependent variables are the nominal (Nominal) and synthetic (Synth.) yields, the expected short rate (ESR), the term premium (TP), the credit risk premium (CRP) and the forward premium (FP). All dependent variables are expressed in basis points. The explanatory variables are the U.S. expected short rate (US ER), the U.S. term premium (US TP), the log of the Vix, the global EPU index (EPU), the industrial production-based global activity index (Global IP), inflation, unemployment and the monthly returns in the Standard \& Poor's stock market index (S\&P), the price of oil for the WTI benchmark (Oil) and the exchange rate (FX). All cases include country fixed effects. Heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent standard errors are in parenthesis. *, **, *** asterisks respectively indicate significance at the 10\%, 5\% and 1\% level.}
