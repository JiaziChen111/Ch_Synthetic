                   show that sovereigns increasingly borrow from
                   foreigners in local currency but the private sector
                   continues to borrow in foreign currency. We show that
                   a higher reliance on foreign currency corporate
                   financing is associated with more sovereign default
                   risk. We introduce local currency sovereign debt and
                   private currency mismatch into a standard sovereign
                   debt model to examine how the currency composition of
                   corporate borrowing affects the sovereign's incentive
                   to inflate or default. A calibration of the model
                   generates the empirical patterns of currency and
                   sovereign credit risk over the last decade. ∗We},

                   market sovereign borrowing and a rapidly growing
                   share of foreign holding of emerging market debt. We
                   introduce a new measure of local currency sovereign
                   risk, the local currency credit spread, defined as
                   the yield spread of a local currency bond over the
                   local currency risk-free rate implied from cross
                   currency swaps. From a dollar investor's perspective,
                   this measure gives the synthetic dollar spread on
                   holding a local currency bond after fully hedging the
                   currency risk of promised cash flows. Compared with
                   the traditional measure of sovereign risk based on
                   credit spreads on foreign currency denominated debt,
                   we find that local currency credit spreads have lower
                   means, are less correlated across countries and less
                   sensitive to global risk factors. We develop a model

                   dramatically since the start of the global financial
                   crisis. For example, estimates using the
                   Laubach–Williams (2003) model indicate the natural
                   rate in the United States fell to close to zero
                   during the crisis and has remained there into 2016.
                   Explanations for this decline include shifts in
                   demographics, a slowdown in trend productivity
                   growth, and global factors affecting real interest

                   what drives inflation globally and domestically;
                   where inflation expectations have become

                   yields is, on balance, comparable to that of
                   conventional policy. In addition, a conventional U.S.
                   monetary easing (tightening) leads to a significant
                   narrowing (widening) of credit spreads on sovereign

                   the response of sovereign credit spreads to US
                   monetary policy differs between policy easings and
                   tightenings and find no evidence of such asymmetry.},

                   sheet policies undertaken by the Federal Reserve and
                   European Central Bank. In principle, conventional
                   monetary policy affects bond yields and financial
                   conditions by affecting the expected path of short
                   rates, while balance-sheet policy is believed act
                   through the term premium. To distinguish the effects
                   of these two types of policies we use a term
                   structure model to decompose longer-term bond yields
                   into expected short-term interest rates and term
                   premiums. We then examine the relative effects of
                   changes in these two components of yields on changes
                   in exchange rates and foreign bond yields. We find
                   that the sensitivity of the dollar to monetary policy
                   announcements has risen since the GFC, and most of
                   this rise owes to an increased sensitivity of the
                   dollar to expected interest rates rather than to term
                   premiums. We also find that changes in short rates
                   and term premiums have similar effects on foreign
                   yields. Our findings contradict the popular view that
                   quantitative easing exerts greater international
                   spillovers than conventional monetary policies. 1},

                   on the same reference entity. The theoretical
                   no-arbitrage relationship between the two credit
                   spreads is confronted with daily data from six
                   Euro-area countries over the period 2004-2011. As a
                   first step, the supposed non stationarity of the two
                   series is verified. Then, we examine whether the
                   non-stationary CDS and bond spreads series are bound
                   by a cointegration relationship. Overall the
                   cointegration analysis confirms that the two prices
                   should be equal to each other in equilibrium, as
                   theory predicts. Nonetheless the theoretical value
                   [1, -1] for the cointegrating vector is rejected,
                   meaning that in the short run the cash and synthetic
                   market's valuation of credit risk differ to various
                   degrees. The VECM analysis suggests that the CDS
                   market moves ahead of the bond market in terms of
                   price discovery. These findings are further supported
                   by the Granger Causality Test: for most sovereigns in
                   the sample, past values of CDS spreads help to
                   forecast bond yield spreads. Short-run deviations
                   from the equilibrium persist longer than it would
                   take for participants in one market to observe the
                   price in the other. That is consistent with the
                   hypothesis of imperfections in the arbitrage
                   relationship between the two markets.},

                   fills that void by making public the Treasury yield
                   curve estimates of the Federal Reserve Board at a
                   daily frequency from 1961 to the present. We use a
                   well-known and simple smoothing method that is shown
                   to fit the data very well. The resulting estimates
                   can be used to compute yields or forward rates for

                   emphasis on recent developments at the intersection
                   of macroeconomics and finance. The topic is important
                   to investors and also to policymakers, who wish to
                   extract macroeconomic expectations from longer-term
                   interest rates, and take actions to influence those
                   rates. The simplest model of the term structure is
                   the expectations hypothesis, which posits that
                   long-term interest rates are expectations of future
                   average short-term rates. In this paper, we show that
                   many features of the configuration of interest rates
                   are puzzling from the perspective of the expectations
                   hypothesis. We review models that explain these
                   anomalies using time-varying risk premia. Although
                   the quest for the fundamental macroeconomic
                   explanations of these risk premia is ongoing,
                   inflation uncertainty seems to play a large role.
                   Finally, while modern finance theory prices bonds and
                   other assets in a single unified framework, we also
                   consider an earlier approach based on segmented
                   markets. Market segmentation seems important to
                   understand the term structure of interest rates

                   illustrate this with a Gaussian affine DTSM augmented
                   with 3 to 24-month OIS rates, which provide accurate

                   accurately depict their daily frequency evolution,

                   main channels. The first is the determination of
                   domestic inflation when international prices and
                   global competition play a role alongside domestic
                   slack and inflation expectations. The second channel
                   is the determination of asset returns (including the
                   natural real safe rate of interest, r∗) and
                   financial conditions in integrated global financial
                   markets. The third channel, particular to the United
                   States, is the potential spillback onto the U.S.
                   economy from the disproportionate influence of U.S.
                   monetary policy on the outside world. In themselves,
                   global factors need not undermine a central bank's
                   ability to control the price level over the long
                   term—after all, it is the monopoly issuer of the
                   numeraire in which domestic prices are measured. Over
                   shorter horizons, however, global factors do change
                   the tradeoff between pricelevel control and other
                   goals such as low unemployment and financial
                   stability, thereby affecting the policy cost of

                   made it so. The main finding is that the univariate
                   inflation process is well described by an unobserved
                   component trend-cycle model with stochastic
                   volatility or, equivalently, an integrated moving
                   average process with time-varying parameters. This
                   model explains a variety of recent univariate
                   inflation forecasting puzzles and begins to explain
                   some multivariate inflation forecasting puzzles as
                   well. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Ohio State

                   money center banks acting as intermediaries. We
                   capture the concept of tiering by developing a
                   core-periphery model, and devise a procedure for
                   fitting the model to real-world networks. Using
                   Bundesbank data on bilateral interbank exposures
                   among 2000 banks from 1999 to 2012, we find strong
                   evidence of tiering in the German banking system.
                   This extent of tiering is unlikely to arise in
                   standard random networks. Indeed, we show that bank
                   specialization and balance sheet variables predict

                   natural alternative to estimating impulse responses

  abstract =      {The sensitivity of long-term nominal and real rates
                   to short-term rates represents a puzzle for standard
                   macro-finance models. We find that post-FOMC
                   announcement drift in Treasury markets after Fed
                   Funds target changes contributes to this excess
                   sensitivity of long rates. The expectations
                   hypothesis holds on FOMC announcement days, but fails
                   thereafter. Mutual fund investors respond to Fed
                   Funds target rate increases by selling short and
                   intermediate duration bond funds, thus gradually
                   increasing the effective supply of these bonds. Using
                   FOMC-induced variation in bond fund flows, we
                   estimate short-run demand for Treasurys to be
                   inelastic, especially for longer maturities. The
                   gradual increase in supply, combined with the low
                   demand elasticity, account for the post-announcement
                   drift in Treasurys, which then spreads to other bond
                   markets. Our findings shed new light on the causes of
                   time-series-momentum in Treasury markets.},

  year =          {2018},
  abstract =      {In November 2008, the Federal Reserve faced a
                   deteriorating economy and a financial crisis. The
                   federal funds rate had already been reduced to
                   virtually zero. Thus, the Federal Reserve turned to
                   unconventional monetary policies. Through
                   "quantitative easing," the Fed announced plans to buy
                   mortgage-backed securities and debt issued by
                   government-sponsored enterprises. Subsequent
                   purchases would eventually lead to a five-fold
                   expansion in the Fed's balance sheet, from {\$}900
                   billion to {\$}4.5 trillion, and leave the Fed
                   holding over 20 percent of all mortgage-backed
                   securities and marketable Treasury debt. In addition,
                   Fed policy statements in December 2008 began to
                   include explicit references to the likely path of the
                   federal funds interest rate, a policy that came to be
                   known as "forward guidance." The Fed ceased its
                   direct asset purchases in late 2014. Starting in
                   October 2017, it has allowed the balance sheet to
                   shrink gradually as existing assets mature. From
                   December 2015 through June 2018, the Fed has raised
                   the federal funds interest rate seven times. Thus,
                   the time is ripe to step back and ask whether the
                   Fed's unconventional policies had the intended
                   expansionary effects—and by extension, whether the
                   Fed should use them in the future.},
