abstract = {We find that deviations from the covered interest rate parity condition (CIP) imply large, persistent, and systematic arbitrage opportunities in one of the largest asset markets in the world. Contrary to the common view, these deviations for major currencies are not explained away by credit risk or transaction costs. They are particularly strong for forward contracts that appear on the banks' balance sheets at the end of the quarter, pointing to a causal effect of banking regulation on asset prices. The CIP deviations also appear significantly correlated with other fixed-income spreads and with nominal interest rates.},

abstract = {This paper examines when and why capital sometimes surges to emerging market economies (EMEs). Using data on net capital flows for 56 EMEs over 1980-2011, we find that global factors, including US interest rates and investor risk aversion act as "gatekeepers" that determine when surges of capital to EMEs will occur. Whether a particular EME receives a surge, and the magnitude of that surge, however, depends largely on domestic factors such as its external financing need, capital account openness, and exchange rate regime. Differentiating between surges driven by exceptional behavior of asset flows (repatriation of foreign assets by domestic residents) from those driven by exceptional behavior of liability flows (nonresident investments into the country), shows the latter to be relatively more sensitive to global factors and contagion. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Journal of International Economics 14, 3-24] that the exchange rate is well approximated by a driftless random walk, at least for prediction purposes, still stands despite much effort at constructing other forecasting models. However, in several other macro and financial forecasting applications, researchers in recent years have considered methods for forecasting that effectively combine the information in a large number of time series. In this paper, I apply one such method for pooling forecasts from several different models, Bayesian Model Averaging, to the problem of pseudo out-of-sample exchange rate predictions. For most currency-horizon pairs, the Bayesian Model Averaging forecasts using a sufficiently high degree of shrinkage, give slightly smaller out-of-sample mean square prediction error than the random walk benchmark. The forecasts generated by this model averaging methodology are however very close to, but not identical to, those from the random walk forecast. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We find that US Treasury curve invokes significant positive responses on HKD swap curve due to the existence of the currency peg system. Our work also indicates that Hong Kong swap curve itself contains rich information over and above that provided by the sovereign yield curve and the standard measure of market liquidity, Libor-type interest rates. Hence, using sovereign yield curves and concentrating only on the risk premium associated with the breakdown of the currency peg is not sufficient for policy making.

This paper evaluates the importance of these restrictions when using the term structure to forecast future bond yields. It concludes that no cross-sectional restrictions are helpful, because cross-sectional properties of yields are easy to infer with high precision. Dynamic restrictions are useful, but can be imposed without relying on the no-arbitrage structure. In practice, the most important dynamic restriction is that the first principal component of Treasury yields follows a random walk. A simple model built around this assumption produces out-of-sample forecasts that are more accurate than those of a variety of alternative dynamic models.},

abstract = {We assess the importance of economic fundamentals in the transmission of international shocks to financial markets in various emerging market economies (EMEs), covering the so-called taper-tantrum episode of 2013 and seven other episodes of severe EME-wide financial stress since the mid-1990s. Cross-country regressions lead us to the following results: (1) EMEs with relatively better economic fundamentals suffered less deterioration in financial markets during the 2013 taper-tantrum episode. (2) Differentiation among EMEs set in relatively early and persisted through this episode. (3) During the taper tantrum, while controlling for the EMEs' economic fundamentals, financial conditions also deteriorated more in those EMEs that had earlier experienced larger private capital inflows and greater exchange rate appreciation. (4) During the EME crises of the 1990s and early 2000s, we find little evidence of investor differentiation across EMEs being explained by differences in their relative vulnerabilities. (5) However, differentiation across EMEs based on fundamentals does not appear to be unique to the 2013 episode; it also occurred during the global financial crisis of 2008 and, subsequently, during financial stress episodes related to the European sovereign crisis in 2011 and China's financial market stresses in 2015.},

abstract = {One of the most robust stylized facts in macroeconomics is the forecasting power of the term spread for future real activity. The economic rationale for this forecasting power usually appeals to expectations of future interest rates, which affect the slope of the term structure. In this paper, we propose a possible causal mechanism for the forecasting power of the term spread, deriving from the balance sheet management of financial intermediaries. When monetary tightening is associated with a flattening of the term spread, it reduces net interest margin, which in turn makes lending less profitable, leading to a contraction in the supply of credit. We provide empirical support for this hypothesis, thereby linking monetary cycles, financial cycles, and the business cycle.},

It analyzes the effect of the global financial cycle, measured by the VIX, on capital flows and investigates the role of fundamentals and country characteristics in mitigating or amplifying its effect. Using interaction models, we find the effect of the VIX to be non-linear. For low levels of the VIX, capital flows are driven by fundamental factors. During periods of stress, the VIX becomes the dominant driver of capital flows while other determinants, with the exception of interest rate differentials, lose statistical significance. Our results also suggest that the effect of global financial conditions on gross private capital flows increases with the host country's level of financial sector development. Finally, our results imply that countries cannot fully insulate themselves from global financial shocks, unless creating a fragmented global financial system.},

This paper examines three components of international credit and highlights several of the policy challenges that arise in constraining such credit. Our empirical findings suggest that international credit enables domestic credit booms in emerging markets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that higher levels of international credit on the eve of a crisis are associated with larger subsequent contractions in overall credit and real output. In Asia today, international credit generally is small in relation to overall credit – as was not the case before the Asian crisis. So even though dollar credit is growing very rapidly in some Asian economies, its contribution to overall credit growth has been modest outside the more dollarised economies of Asia.},

abstract = {We examine whether a knowledge of in-sample co-movement across countries can be used in a more systematic way to improve the forecast accuracy at the national level. In particular, we ask whether a model with common international business cycle factors adds marginal predictive power over a domestic alternative. We answer this question using a dynamic factor model (DFM), and run an out-of-sample forecasting experiment. Our results show that exploiting the informational content in a common global business cycle factor improves the forecast accuracy in terms of both point and density forecast evaluation across a large panel of countries. We also document evidence showing that the Great Recession has a huge impact on this result, causing a clear shift in preferences towards the model that includes a common global factor. However, this time is different in other respects too, as the performance of the DFM deteriorates substantially for longer forecasting horizons in the aftermath of the Great Recession.},
annote = {The paper asks whether a model considering a global (and regional) factor(s) provides marginal improvements over a benchmark domestic autoregressive process (in both point and density measures). The answer is affirmative but although predictive accuracy improves during the great recession it declines afterwards for longer forecating horizons, which can be partially explain by using regional factors.

It seems to suggest that the global factor plays a more relevant role at short-term horizons. If so, this might be one explaination to the difference between Forster et al. (2014) and Sarno et al. (2016), the higher frequency.

The paper also finds that regional factors matter, at least for better short-term forecasting performance.

Considering global and regional factors can provide parsimony and marginal improvements in predictive power.

We also find that: i) breaking down net external debt into its gross asset and liability counterparts does not add significant explanatory power to crisis prediction; ii) the current account is a powerful predictor; iii) foreign exchange reserves reduce the likelihood of crisis more than other foreign asset holdings; and iv) a parsimonious probit containing those and a handful of other variables has good predictive performance in- and out-of-sample. The latter result stems largely from our focus on external crises sensu stricto.},

abstract = {We study the dynamic response of gross capital flows in emerging market economies to different global financial shocks, using a panel vector-autoregressive (PVAR) approach. Our focus lies primarily on the potentially stabilizing role played by domestic investors in offsetting the response of foreign investors to adverse global shocks. We find that, while foreign investors tend to retrench from emerging markets in response to global risk aversion and monetary policy shocks, foreign asset repatriation by resident investors does not always follow suit. Local investors play a meaningful stabilizing role in the face of global risk aversion shocks, with sizeable asset repatriation largely offsetting the retrenchment of non-residents. In contrast, foreign investor retrenchment in response to global monetary policy shocks is not mirrored by asset repatriation. Finally, we find robust evidence that positive global real shocks tend to have a positive impact on net capital inflows to emerging markets. Our results shed light on the likely impact of the Fed's QE tapering on capital flows to emerging market economies.},

We perform a horse-race among a large set of traditional and recently developed forecasting methods, and discuss a number of principles that emerge from this exercise. We find that judgmental survey forecasts outperform model-based ones, often by a wide margin. A very simple forecast that is just a glide path between the survey assessment of inflation in the current-quarter and the long-run survey forecast value turns out to be competitive with the actual survey forecast and thereby does about as well or better than model-based forecasts. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of some specific prediction methods, including forecasts based on the Phillips curve and based on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models, in greater detail. We also consider measures of inflation expectations taken from financial markets and the tradeoff between forecasting aggregates and disaggregates. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

This allows our measures to incorporate additional high-frequency financial information rela-tive to a simpler common-frequency modelling approach. Using our methodology to analyse the structure and dynamics of macro-financial spillovers in the US economy we obtain estimated spillovers that are substantially higher than those from the anal-ogous common-frequency approach, suggesting that spillover magnitude may be un-derestimated using methods that ignore this additional high-frequency information. We find that the financial markets are typically net transmitters of shocks to the non-financial side of the economy, particularly during turbulent market conditions. However, during the recent crisis we also observe significant spillovers travelling in the opposite direction, suggesting that these linkages are bidirectional in nature. Finally, in agreement with the existing literature, we find significant heterogeneity in the response of the bond and equity markets to common macroeconomic shocks.},

This paper tries to fill this gap in the literature by examining the effects of country-specific uncertainty shocks on cross-border banking flows using the confidential Bank for International Settlements Locational Banking Statistics data. The dyadic structure of this data allows to disentangle supply and demand factors and to better identify the effect of uncertainty shocks on cross-border banking flows. The results of this analysis suggest that: (i) uncertainty is both a push and pull factor that robustly predicts a decrease in both outflows (retrenchment) and inflows (stops); (ii) global banks rebalance their lending towards safer foreign borrowers from local borrowers when facing higher uncertainty; (iii) this rebalancing occurs only towards advanced economies (flight to quality), but not emerging market economies.},

In out-of-sample forecasting exercises, inclusion of the jump mean can reduce the root mean square prediction error by up to 40{\%}. The incremental return predictability captured by the realized jump mean largely accounts for the countercyclical movements in bond risk premia.

This friction has been mostly neglected by macroeconomic models of financial imperfections, which have focused almost exclusively on the effects of limited pledgeability. In this paper, we fill this gap by developing a standard growth model with adverse selection. Our main results are that, by fostering unproductive investment, adverse selection: (i) leads to an increase in the economy's equilibrium interest rate, and; (ii) it generates a negative wedge between the marginal return to investment and the equilibrium interest rate. Under international financial integration, we show how this translates into excessive capital inflows and endogenous cycles. We also extend our model to the more general case in which adverse selection and limited pledgeability coexist. We conclude that both frictions complement one another and show that limited pledgeability exacerbates the effects of adverse selection. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

A position that is not held open overnight receives no interest differential because intradaily interest rates are zero.

The topic is important to investors and also to policymakers, who wish to extract macroeconomic expectations from longer-term interest rates, and take actions to influence those rates. The simplest model of the term structure is the expectations hypothesis, which posits that long-term interest rates are expectations of future average short-term rates. In this paper, we show that many features of the configuration of interest rates are puzzling from the perspective of the expectations hypothesis. We review models that explain these anomalies using time-varying risk premia. Although the quest for the fundamental macroeconomic explanations of these risk premia is ongoing, inflation uncertainty seems to play a large role. Finally, while modern finance theory prices bonds and other assets in a single unified framework, we also consider an earlier approach based on segmented markets. Market segmentation seems important to understand the term structure of interest rates during the recent financial crisis.},

abstract = {The extraordinary events surrounding the Great Recession have cast a considerable doubt on the traditional sources of macroeconomic instability. In their place, economists have singled out financial and uncertainty shocks as potentially important drivers of economic fluctuations. Empirically distinguishing between these two types of shocks, however, is difficult because increases in economic uncertainty are strongly associated with a widening of credit spreads, an indication of a tightening in financial conditions. This paper uses the penalty function approach within the SVAR framework to examine the interaction between financial conditions and economic uncertainty and to trace out the impact of these two types of shocks on the economy. The results indicate that (1) financial shocks have a significant adverse effect on economic outcomes and that such shocks were an important source of cyclical fluctuations since the mid-1980s; (2) uncertainty shocks, especially those implied by uncertainty proxies that do not rely on financial asset prices, are also an important source of macroeconomic disturbances; and (3) uncertainty shocks have an especially negative economic impact in situations where they elicit a concomitant tightening of financial conditions. Evidence suggests that the Great Recession was likely an acute manifestation of the toxic interaction between uncertainty and financial shocks.},

abstract = {Our main goal is to characterize the determinants of sudden stops caused by domestic vis-{\`{a}}-vis foreign residents. Are the decisions of domestic investors to invest abroad or of foreign investors to cut off funds from the domestic economy governed by the same set of determinants? Given the distribution of different types of sudden stop episodes over time and its different macroeconomic consequences, we argue that their determinants may not be alike. One of the novel aspects of this paper is to characterize sudden stops in capital flows (frequency, consequences and determinants) using quarterly data on gross flows for a wide array of countries from 1975 to 2010. We find that foreign investors are less likely to stop bringing capital when the domestic economy is growing and its performance is leveraged by positive external shocks. Domestic agents, on the other hand, are more willing to invest abroad if there are high external savings (current account surpluses), especially in natural-resource abundant countries. Rising financial openness makes the domestic country more vulnerable to sudden stops caused by either local or global investors. Finally, rising risk aversion in world capital markets tend to reduce the likelihood of outflow-driven stops-which may signal a larger propensity towards capital repatriation by domestic investors. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The proposed method allows for correlations between observable and unobservable factors and also allows for cross-sectional and serial dependence and heteroskedasticities in the error structure, which are common in financial markets. In addition, theoretical properties are established for the procedure. We apply the method to analyze the returns for over 6,000 international stocks from over 100 financial markets. The empirical analysis quantifies the extent to which the U.S subprime crisis spilled over to the global financial markets.

Based on a sample of about 50 EMEs over 2005Q1–2013Q4, we find that EME policy makers respond proactively to capital inflows by using a combination of policy tools: central banks raise the policy interest rate to address economic overheating concerns; intervene in the foreign exchange market to resist currency appreciation pressures; tighten macroprudential measures to dampen credit growth; and deploy capital inflow controls in the face of competitiveness and financial-stability concerns. Contrary to conventional policy advice to EMEs, we find no evidence of counter-cyclical fiscal policy in the face of capital inflows. Overall, policies are more likely to respond, and used in combination, during inflow surges than in more normal times.},

This paper empirically assesses the relative contribution of common (push) and country-specific (pull) factors to the variation of bond and equity flows from the US to 55 other countries. Using a Bayesian dynamic latent factor model, we find that more than 80{\%} of the variation in bond and equity flows is due to push factors from the US to other countries. Hence global economic forces seem to prevail over domestic economic forces in explaining movements in international portfolio flows. The dynamics of push and pull factors can be partially explained by US and foreign economic fundamentals.},
annote = {Objective: determine the contribution of push and pull factors to the variation of international bond and equity flows.

Big point: what drives international PORTFOLIO flows? what are their determinants

Big picture: capital flows have increase dramatically over the last two decades, they can have negative consequences on reciepient countries so countries need to be able to manage those flows, knowing their drives helps to design better policies to manage them.

Hypothesis: a dynamic latent factor model allows to determine what are the drivers of bond and equity flows, it decomposes the time variation of the flows into push and pull factors: "the factor dynamics are captured by their serial correlation." p.60

Data: monthly bond and equity flows (they seem OUTFLOWS) from the U.S. to 55 countries, from January 1988 to November 2013.

Theories: standard economic fundamentals

Methodology: Bayesian dynamic latent MULTIFACTOR model (THREE types of latent persistent factors: global, asset-specific, country-specific) is flexible but high-dimensional (397 parameters to estimate), panel unit-root tests, time series to explain global factors, panel to explain the push factor.

Results: global (not domestic) factors are the primary drivers of international portfolio flows (explain more than 80{\%} of their variance - Table 2), little relative contribution of regional factors - Table 3. During the crisis "the global component of the push factor increases its contribution." Economic variables explains 1/4 of the variation in the push and pull factors. The push factor is associated with U.S. economic variables (industrial gap, 10 yr yield, US/World stock return, dVIX, TED), and the pull factors by domestic ones (industrial gap, 10 yr yield, stock return, Chinn-Ito, lagged pull factor). 

Conclusion: capital controls may be more effective than macroeconomic policies for managing capital flows.

Quotations: Explanations of Bayesian estimation, PCA, carry trade.

How this article influence my research: among recent papers using factor models to explain push/pull factors; this one saying that global factors are more important.

Instead of using TIC data I could use EPFR with weekly and monthly frequency, and then use quarterly BPM data following Forster et al. (2014) to see if frequency plays a role. Note also, the authors did not normalize the flows per GDP.},

abstract = {We study empirically and theoretically the influence of financial frictions on the cyclical dynamics of producer prices. Empirical results show that the response of industry-specific PPI inflation to changes in aggregate financial conditions depends importantly on differences in the ease of access to external finance across industries: In industries in which firms face a high likelihood of financial constraints, inflation is insensitive to changes in financial conditions; in industries where firms have a relatively unfettered access to external finance, by contrast, infla-tion declines significantly in response to a tightening of financial conditions. Firm-level pricing behavior during the 2007–09 financial crisis confirms these general findings: Firms' pre-crisis internal liquidity positions had a significant effect on firms that increased their prices relative to their industry average during the Great Recession. On the theoretical side, we use the model developed by Gilchrist, Schoenle, Sim, and Zakraj{\v{s}}ek (2015b) to analyze the implications of the interaction between customer markets and financial frictions for economic outcomes. Using a version of the model calibrated to study normal business cycle conditions, we confirm their orig-inal findings that this interaction significantly attenuates the response of inflation to demand shocks and produces a strong negative comovement between inflation and output in response to financial shocks. In light of the latter result, we also explore the macroeconomic implication of different interest-rate policy rules. In response to financial shocks, rules that put a great deal of weight on inflation stabilization lead to significantly worse economic outcomes than rules aimed at stabilizing output.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the behavior of gross capital inflows across 34 emerging markets (EMs). We first confirm that aggregate inflows to EMs co-move considerably. We then report three findings: (i) the aggregate co-movement conceals significant heterogeneity across asset types as only bank-related and portfolio bond and equity inflows do co-move; (ii) while global push factors in advanced economies mostly explain the common dynamics, their relative importance varies by type of flow; and (iii) the sensitivity to common dynamics varies significantly across borrower countries, with market structure characteristics (especially the composition of the foreign investor base and the level of liquidity) rather than borrower country's institutional fundamentals strongly affecting sensitivities. Countries relying more on international funds and global banks are found to be more sensitive to push factors. Our findings suggest that EMs need to closely monitor their lenders and investors to assess their inflow exposures to global push factors.},
annote = {Flows do co-move, mainly portfolio (equity and bond) and bank flows. Global push factors from advance economies explain the co-movement. Sensitivity to common factors varies by borrower country with lenders characteristics playing a bigger role than fundamentals. So EMEs need to monitor lender to assess their sensitivity to push factors.

Data: quarterly BoP, 2001-2003, analysis of total and disaggregated gross inflows, 34 EMEs.

Variables for push factors: G4 GDP growth, VIX, FFR, U.S. term spread, U.S. REER, TED spread, 10 yr U.S yield, lagged EMBI return, lagged MSCI EMI return, commity prices index, lagged real GDP.

Variables for fundamentals: trade openness, public debt, reserves, FX regime, real GDP growth, ICRG index.

Methodology: dynamic latent factor model as in Kose et al. (2003) and similar to the one used by Sarno et al. (2016).

Results: heterogeneity in the variance of capital flows explained by common factor among countries. Three groups: sensitive, asymmetric, insensitive.

Push factors explain most of the variation in the common factor but their importance varies by type of flow.

To explain the variability in the betas (factor loadings), the correlation of the flows with the investor base (EPFR, BIS) play a more important role than macro fundamentals. i.e. EM sensitivity to push factors is mainly driven by investor base rather than macro fundamentals.

They find that the countries with higher betas are associated with deeper retrenchments in flows during GFC and the taper tantrum.

Symptoms can go from benign to large asset price bubbles and excess credit creation, which are among the best predictors of financial crises. A VAR analysis suggests that one of the determinants of the global financial cycle is monetary policy in the centre country, which affects leverage of global banks, capital flows and credit growth in the international financial system.

This has consequences in terms of potentially mis-specifying the co-movements and hence the analysis of impulse response functions—a commonly used tool for economic policy analysis. We introduce a class of mixed frequency VAR models that allows us to measure the impact of high frequency data on low frequency and vice versa. Our approach does not rely on latent processes/shocks representations. As a consequence, the mixed frequency VAR is an alternative to commonly used state space models for mixed frequency data. State space models are parameter-driven whereas mixed frequency VAR models are observation-driven models as they are formulated exclusively in terms of observable data and do not involve latent processes as well as shocks and thus avoid the need to formulate measurement equations, filtering, etc. We also propose various parsimonious parameterizations, in part inspired by recent work on MIDAS regressions. We also explicitly characterize the mis-specification of a traditional common low frequency VAR and its implied mis-specified impulse response functions. The class of mixed frequency VAR models can also characterize the timing of information releases for a mixture of sampling frequencies and the real-time updating of predictions caused by the flow of high frequency information. Various estimation procedures for mixed frequency VAR models are also proposed, both classical and Bayesian. Numerical and empirical examples quantify the consequences of ignoring mixed frequency data.},

abstract = {It is high time we rediscovered the role of the financial cycle in macroeconomics. In the environment that has prevailed for at least three decades now, it is not possible to understand business fluctuations and the corresponding analytical and policy challenges without understanding the financial cycle. This calls for a rethink of modelling strategies and for significant adjustments to macroeconomic policies. This essay highlights the stylised empirical features of the financial cycle, conjectures as to what it may take to model it satisfactorily, and considers its policy implications. In the discussion of policy, the essay pays special attention to the bust phase, which is less well explored and raises much more controversial issues. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The main conclusion is that none of our models is consistent with basic properties of nominal yields. It is difficult to explain the average shape of the nominal yield curve, the variation of yields over time, and the predictability of excess bond returns. There are two overarching problems. First, much of the variation over time in economic activity is orthogonal to variation in nominal yields, and vice versa. Second, although mean excess returns to nominal Treasury bonds are positive, these returns do not appear to positively covary with risks that require compensation, at least according to standard asset-pricing models. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Since the onset of the crisis, these imbalances have contracted to a significant extent. In this paper, we analyze the ongoing process of external adjustment in advanced economies and emerging markets. We find that countries whose pre-crisis current account balances were in excess of what could be explained by standard economic fundamentals have experienced the largest contractions in their external balance. We subsequently examine the contributions of real exchange rates, domestic demand and domestic output to the adjustment process (allowing for differences across exchange rate regimes) and find that external adjustment in deficit countries was achieved primarily through demand compression, rather than expenditure switching. Finally, we show that changes in other investment flows were the main channel of financial account adjustment, with official external assistance and ECB liquidity cushioning the exit of private capital flows for some countries. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Second, the transmission to GDP growth in European countries has increased gradu-ally since the 1980s, consistent with {\ldots}nancial globalization. A more marked increase is detected in the early 1980s in the US itself, consistent with changes in the conduct of monetary policy. Third, the size of US {\ldots}nancial shocks varies strongly over time, with the 'global {\ldots}nancial crisis shock' being very large by historical standards and explaining 30 percent of the variation in GDP growth on average over all countries in 2008-2009, compared to a little less than 10 percent over the 1971-2007 period. Finally, large collapses in house prices, exports and TFP are the main drivers of the strong worldwide propagation of US {\ldots}nancial shocks during the crisis.},

From a dollar investor's perspective, this measure gives the synthetic dollar spread on holding a local currency bond after fully hedging the currency risk of promised cash flows. Compared with the traditional measure of sovereign risk based on credit spreads on foreign currency denominated debt, we find that local currency credit spreads have lower means, are less correlated across countries and less sensitive to global risk factors. We develop a model of partially segmented domestic and external sovereign debt markets and test the model's differential predictions for the risk premium and the term structure of credit spreads on the two types of debt. We find that imperfect market integration via risky credit arbitrage is important for the differential pricing of local and foreign currency debt.},

We first empirically document that a US contractionary monetary policy shock leads a retrenchment in EME capital flows, a fall in EME GDP, and an exchange rate depreciation. We construct a theoretical model that can help to account for these findings. In the model, macroeconomic spillovers may be exacerbated by financial frictions. Absent financial frictions, international spillovers are minor, and an inflation targeting rule represents an effective policy for the EME. With frictions in financial intermediation, however, spillovers are substantially magnified, and an inflation targeting rule has little advantage over an exchange rate peg. However, an optimal monetary policy markedly improves on the performance of naive inflation targeting or an exchange rate peg. Furthermore, optimal policies don't need to be coordinated across countries. A non-cooperative, self-oriented optimal policy gives results very similar to those of a global cooperative optimal policy.},

The second channel, which is associated with the supply side of finance, emphasises the implications of changes in financial intermediaries' balance sheets for the supply of credit, liquidity and asset prices, and, consequently, for macroeconomic outcomes.

Forecast combination: linear forcasting schemes are popular (weights are estimated by OLS), combinations of models with a intercalated few predictors, Bayesian model averaging, Geweke {\&} Amisano (2011).

Model instability: density and/or parameter change. Instability can be detected but its exact form not. Two options: parametric modeling of instability (mean-reverting slope coefficiens, regime switching process, second moments -volatility-) and robust procedures (rolling window, exponential smoothing, intercept corrections, combination of parametric instability models).

Using different combination methods with different models allowing for parameter instability (including time-varying volatility) tuned out to have good performance (Pettenuzzo {\&} Timmermann 2016).

abstract = {We study the finite-sample properties of some of the standard techniques used to estimate modern term structure models. For sample sizes and models similar to those used in most empirical work, we reach three surprising conclusions. First, while maximum likelihood works well for simple models, it produces strongly biased parameter estimates when the model includes a flexible specification of the dynamics of interest rate risk. Second, despite having the same asymptotic efficiency as maximum likelihood, the small-sample performance of Efficient Method of Moments (a commonly used method for estimating complicated models) is unacceptable even in the simplest term structure settings. Third, the linearized Kalman filter is a tractable and reasonably accurate estimation technique, which we recommend in settings where maximum likelihood is impractical.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes waves in international capital flows. We develop a new methodology for identifying episodes of extreme capital flow movements using data that differentiates activity by foreigners and domestics. We identify episodes of "surges" and "stops" (sharp increases and decreases, respectively, of gross inflows) and "flight" and "retrenchment" (sharp increases and decreases, respectively, of gross outflows). Our approach yields fundamentally different results than the previous literature that used measures of net flows. Global factors, especially global risk, are significantly associated with extreme capital flow episodes. Contagion, whether through trade, banking, or geography, is also associated with stop and retrenchment episodes. Domestic macroeconomic characteristics are generally less important, and we find little association between capital controls and the probability of having surges or stops driven by foreign capital flows. The results provide insights for different theoretical approaches explaining crises and capital flow volatility. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The events of the past decade or more highlight the further complications for this framework posed by financial stability issues. Here we update and qualify our prior analysis, drawing on recent experience and research. Under the classical gold standard, scant attention was paid to macro management, either to stabilize output and employment or to ensure financial stability. The interwar years highlighted the changing demands for modern central bank interventions in the economy. Financial instability, followed by WWII, left a world with sharply constricted financial markets and little private cross-border capital mobility. Due to this historical accident, the Bretton Woods system agreed in 1944 focused not at all on financial stability, and focused on issues like adjustment, exchange rate misalignment, and international liquidity (defined in terms of official, not private, capital-account transactions). Post 1970s floating rates permitted, but did not require, liberalization of the capital account. But the political equilibrium had shifted in favor of financial interests, signaled by the push toward European integration and the later reform process in emerging markets starting in the 1990s. This development, however, opened the door once again to domestic financial crises and their international transmission. Countries now become more susceptible to a new species of " capital account crises, " fueled by bank and bond lending, and its sudden withdrawal. These developments, in fact, made evident a different, " financial trilemma " : countries can pick at most two from {\{}financial stability, open capital markets, and autonomy over domestic financial policy{\}}. We distill the main lessons as to the interactions between the monetary and financial trilemmas, and policies that could best address the resulting weaknesses.},

The study uses unique monthly micro-level data of benchmark compositions and mutual fund investments during 1996–2012. Benchmarks have important effects on equity and bond mutual fund portfolios across funds with different degrees of activism. Benchmarks explain, on average, around 70 percent of country allocations and have significant impact even on active funds. Benchmark effects are important after controlling for industry, macroeconomic, and country- specific, time-varying effects. Reverse causality does not drive the results. Exogenous, pre-announced changes in benchmarks result in movements in asset allocations mostly when these changes are implemented (not when announced). By impacting country allocations, benchmarks affect capital flows across countries through direct and indirect channels, including contagion. They explain apparently counterintuitive movements in capital flows, generating outflows from countries when upgraded and with large market capitalization and better relative performance},

An expanding literature discusses negative effects on growth and stability of this change in credit allocation. We research its drivers. We hypothesize that if foreign capital flows into economies with few investment opportunities, it may substitute for domestic bank lending to non-financial business, so that bank balance sheets become more dominated by household lending. In GMM estimations on data for 36 economies over 1990-2011, we find evidence consistent with this mechanism. Foreign capital inflows into the non-bank sector (but not into the bank sector) are associated with lower shares of business lending in domestic bank portfolios. The association is weaker in economies with more investment opportunities, whether proxied by investment shares, current account surpluses, or EMU membership. Our results highlight the importance of sectoral destination in determining the effects of capital flows.},

I find that external adjustment following endowment shocks predominantly takes place via trade flows, consistent with the intertemporal approach to the current account. In contrast, preference shocks that change investors' risk aversion induce adjustment via the trade and valuation channels; where the latter includes the effects of unexpected capital gains and loss on existing cross border holdings and changes in the expected future return differentials between foreign assets and liabilities. The model estimates imply that the valuation channel of external adjustment is more important for the U.S. than the trade channel. Consistent with this implication, I show that forecasts of future return differentials contributed most to the volatility of the U.S. net foreign asset position in the post Bretton-Woods era. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Despite a historically unique build-up in aggregate flows prior to the global financial crisis, network density in 2007 was comparable to earlier peaks. This suggests that factors other than connectedness, such as the location of the initial shock to the core of the network, have contributed to the severity of the crisis.

A shift in market expectations towards easier future U.S. monetary policy leads to greater foreign portfolio inflows and vice versa.

Gross capital flows are also pro-cyclical. During expansions, foreigners invest more domestically and domestic agents invest more abroad. During crises, total gross flows collapse and there is a retrenchment in both inflows by foreigners and outflows by domestic agents. These patterns hold for different types of capital flows and crises. This evidence sheds light on the sources of fluctuations driving capital flows and helps discriminate among existing theories.

We decompose debt inflows by borrower type: banks, corporates and sovereigns. Using our new data, we present dynamic and cross sectional patterns in capital inflows as a function of global push factors and countries' own business cycles. This exercise reveals that patterns evident in aggregate capital flows data do not hold up consistently across different borrower types. When global risk appetite is low, as proxied by high VIX, capital flows into banks and corporates decline both in advanced economies (AE) and in emerging markets (EM). This is also true for EM sovereigns but not for AE, whose sovereign borrowing does not respond to VIX. Banks' and corporates' borrowing, both in EM and in AE are procyclical, whereas EM's sovereigns exhibit counter-cyclical borrowing. Capital inflows are procyclical in all assets classes except for portfolio debt inflows to EM, which exhibit a countercyclical pattern driven mainly by EM sovereigns and to some extent by EM corporates. Our results highlight the importance of separating capital flows by borrower type for understanding potential systemic risks related to capital flows, and show the difficulty of establishing robust stylized facts about capital flows' dynamics in a mixed sample of emerging and advanced countries.},

abstract = {Using the BIS Locational Banking Statistics data on bilateral bank claims from 1995 to 2014, we analyze the impact of monetary policy on cross-border bank flows. We find that monetary policy in the source countries is an important determinant of cross-border bank flows. In addition, we find evidence in favor of a cross-border portfolio reallocation channel that works in parallel with the traditional bank lending channel. As tighter monetary con-ditions in source countries erode the net worth and collateral values of domestic borrowers, banks reallocate credit away from relatively risky domestic borrowers toward safer foreign counterparties. The cross-border reallocation of credit is more pronounced for banks in source countries with higher prevalence of household credit and weaker financial sectors. Also, the reallocation is directed especially toward foreign non-bank borrowers in advanced economies, or those in economies with investment grade sovereign rating. Thus, our study highlights the spillovers from domestic monetary policy on foreign credit, enhancing the understanding of the international monetary transmission mechanism through global banks.},

abstract = {T wenty years ago, empirical macroeconomists shared some common under-standings. One was that a dynamic causal effect—for example, the effect on output growth of the Federal Reserve increasing the federal funds rate—is properly conceived as the effect of a shock, that is, of an unanticipated autonomous change linked to a specific source. Following Sims (1980), the use of vector autore-gressions to estimate the dynamic causal effect of shocks on economic variables was widespread. There was also an understanding that vector autoregressions, because they impose as little structure on the data as possible, cannot answer questions about changes in policy regimes, such as the macroeconomic consequences of the Fed adopting a new policy rule. For such questions, more structured models grounded in economic theory are needed. At the same time, there was an increasing recog-nition that the available methods needed significant work. The schemes used to identify structural shocks in vector autoregressions were often seen as unconvincing by researchers outside the field, and the small structural models of the time were not econometrically estimated, miring that enterprise in an unhelpful debate over how to calibrate such models. In addition, there were chinks emerging in the theoretical econometric underpinnings of inference in time series data, as well as opportunities for using the much larger datasets becoming available, if only the tools to do so could be developed.

abstract = {The present paper examines the degree of comovement of gross capital inflows, which is a highly sensitive issue for policy makers. We estimate a dynamic hierarchical factor model that is able to decompose inflows in a sample of 47 economies into (i) a global factor common to all types of flows and all recipient countries, (ii) a factor specific to a given type of capital inflows, (iii) a regional factor and (iv) a country-specific component. We find that the latter explains by far the largest fraction of fluctuations in capital inflows followed by regional factors, which are particularly important for emerging markets' FDI and portfolio inflows as well as bank lending to Emerging Europe. The global factor, however, explains only a small share of the overall variation. We also employ dynamic panel and time series regressions to explain the determinants of the estimated components. The global factor is shown to reflect U.S. financial conditions.},
annote = {Big point: the comovement of capital INFLOWS is important to policymakers because the adequate response to those inflows depends on their drivers.

Big picture: swings in capital flows felt by EMEs, repatriatioin at the peak of the GFC, the determinants of capital flows usually split them between common or push and idiosyncratic or pull factors

Hypothesis: since thee are common swings in capital flows, there seems to be a global factor but push factors are common to specific regions and types of flows. Push factors may have different levels of aggregation.

Data: Quarterly data for 47 countries from 1994Q1-2010Q4, three types of flows (FDI, portfolio, other), series are seasonally adjusted, standardized. FDI flows have smallest variation. A standard DFM is likely to have limited explanatory power, correlation among ALL is 0.05

Theories: theory gives conflicting views (effects can be positive or negative) on the relationship between capital flow volatility and other variables (capital controls, trade openness, fix FX, GDP growth).

Methodology: HIERARCHICAL DFM (four factors), panel (to study the determinants of the exposure to the factors: capital openness, deposits/GDP, imports+exports, flexibility of FX, GDP growth and volatility) dynamic panels (determinants of global and idiosyncratic component: debt/GDP, CPI, GDP growth, GDP/capita,KAOPEN), time series (to study the determinants of the global factor: VIX, FFR, U.S. term spread, oil, world inflation, world GDP)

Results: the global factor identifies relevant historic episodes. Portfolio and other flows follow the global factor more closely than FDI. 'Other' inflows to the U.S. follow more closely the global factor, which may be related to the global banking channel. The residual of the global factor is persistent (0.78) -{\textgreater} low frequency.
Variance decomposition analysis shows that the idiosyncratic factor explains 80{\%} of the variability in capital inflows, next is the regional factor (important for EMEs); the global factor explains a small fraction of the volatility.
Weak explanatory power of macro variables for capital flow volatility, but factor differentiation helps with the fit.
The explanatory power of macro variables for the idiosyncratic factor is limited.
Determinants of the global factor: VIX, FFR, U.S. term spread. That is, U.S. variables.

Quotations: "Given that we do not aim to explain capital flows as such in terms of macroeconomic de- terminants, but focus on the idiosyncratic parts only, our results appear acceptable. Moreover, with the dominant role of the lagged endogenous variable it would be too ambitious to expect a larger explanatory power from other variables. It is in this sense that wethink our results compare favourably with those presented in the literature. As a matter of fact, however,we cannot completely rule out that the idiosyncratic factors to some degree reflect noise." p. 117

"The primary responsibility for dealing with large and volatile capital flows remains with domestic policymakers." p. 121

How this article influence my research:
It shows that most of the variation in capital inflows is driven by country-specific components, which seems to conflict with other studies Sarno et al. (2016).
The limited explanatory power of macro variables for the idiosyncratic component: missing stock returns (Guo 2016)?, relevance of mixed frequencies? For example, to explain portfolio flows include past stock market returns (Liang Guo, 2016), local term spread, FX changes.

Extend the results of the paper to outflows and types of borrowers for 'other' flows (banks, government, private), include volatility, mixed frequencies.

Add an additional layer: global, region, type-of-flow, type-of-borrower, idiosyncratic. What about: global, region, type-of-borrower, type-of-flow, idiosyncratic

For example, for type of borrowers, is the effect of global and idiosyncratic factors the same on 'other flows' depending if the receiver is the government, banks, or private firms?},

In our model, domestic stocks are used to hedge fluctuations in local wage income. Terms of trade risk is hedged using bonds denominated in local goods and in foreign goods.

Our evidence seems mostly inconsistent with a significant and conspicuous GFCy; both methods combined rarely explain more than a quarter of the variation in capital flows.

This paper offers an intuitive, practical and robust predictive regression model linking liquid USD-denominated CDS premiums of different tenors to a set of obligor-specific attributes, and with the model one can generate proxy CDS curves for corporates without liquid or traded CDS. One key attribute is the actuarial spread that reflects the actuarial value of a CDS contract and is made available by the Credit Research Initiative of National University of Singapore for all exchange-listed firms globally. Other attributes in the predictive regression model include investment vs. speculative grades based on an obligor's credit rating, and some general credit environment variables such as the April 2009 CDS Big Bang, among others. This predictive regression, constructed with the historical record on 405 corporate CDS names, enables daily production of proxy CDS curves on around 35,000 exchange-listed corporates globally.},

abstract = {This paper discusses pooling versus model selection for nowcasting with large datasets in the presence of model uncertainty. In practice, nowcasting a low-frequency variable with a large number of high-frequency indicators should account for at least two data irregularities: (i) unbalanced data with missing observations at the end of the sample due to publication delays; and (ii) different sampling frequencies of the data. Two model classes suited in this context are factor models based on large datasets and mixed-data sampling (MIDAS) regressions with few predictors. The specification of these models requires several choices related to, amongst other things, the factor estimation method and the number of factors, lag length and indicator selection. Thus there are many sources of misspecification when selecting a particular model, and an alternative would be pooling over a large set of different model specifications. We evaluate the relative performance of pooling and model selection for nowcasting quarterly GDP for six large industrialized countries. We find that the nowcast performance of single models varies considerably over time, in line with the forecasting literature. Model selection based on sequential application of information criteria can outperform benchmarks. However, the results highly depend on the selection method chosen. In contrast, pooling of nowcast models provides an overall very stable nowcast performance over time.},

In general, pull factors have a heavier weight in determining these capital flows. However, short-term dynamics of capital flows can be significantly influenced by external developments. Simulations under various economic scenarios show that while financial variables (such as the US interest rate and high-yield spread) are important, real US activity may be even more potent in influencing capital flow movements.

abstract = {We propose a comprehensive empirical examination of the time-varying leading properties of two high yield spreads in the United States, and compare them with the leading properties of the term spread between the mid-1980s and the end of 2011. In a large set of in-sample and out-of-sample forecast exercises, we show that high yield spreads are not reliable predictors of future economic activity, as measured by the real gross domestic product and industrial production. Their predictive content for economic growth, which is statistically and economically significant between the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the new century, vanishes in the second half of the 2000s. This disappearance is coincident with (i) structural breaks in the relationship, which largely occurred in the early years of the past decade and during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and (ii) the reappearance of the leading properties of the term spread in recent years. In general, despite the recent deterioration of much of their predictive content, high yield spreads still tend to outperform the term spread for predicting economic growth at horizons of up to one year in both the in-sample and out-of-sample exercises, even after accounting for time-varying parameters in the model specifications.},

Still, it is found that Sudden Stops in Gross Inflows that do not provoke a sharp contraction in Net Flows may also be disruptive, particularly Sudden Stops that are driven by "other flows" - which include banking flows.

The results from an eclectic methodology that includes causality tests, generalized impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions indicate that the crisis is mostly transmitted through bank credit rather than portfolio flows and international trade. The results are robust to altering the exogenous versus endogenous vectors of variables, to measuring equity prices in U.S. dollars or local currency, to averaging the data across countries versus averaging the parameters from individual country estimation, and to redefining the start date of the crisis.

abstract = {Using a sample of 34 emerging markets and developing economies over the period 2009Q3-2015Q4, the paper employs a panel framework to study the determinants of capital flows, both net and gross, across a wide range of instruments. The baseline regressions are then extended to focus on high and low episodes – quarters with flows one standard deviation above/below mean. Overall, the results suggest that the capital flow slowdown witnessed in recent years is due to a combination of lower growth prospects of recipient countries and worse global risk sentiment. However, the determinants of flows can be considerably different across instruments and across the type of flows considered, net or gross. The sensitivity of certain types of flows, towards push and pull factors, increases during periods of high and low capital flows. Moreover, some variables may not necessarily be significant during normal times, but can be important drivers during such episodes, and vice versa. Indicators like the gap between the U.S. long-and short-term maturity bond yields – not significant during normal times – can be an important driver during high episodes.},

abstract = {An exciting development in empirical macroeconometrics is the increasing use of external sources of as-if randomness to identify the dynamic causal effects of macroeconomic shocks. This approach – the use of external instruments – is the time series counterpart of the highly successful strategy in microeconometrics of using external as-if randomness to provide instruments that identify causal effects. This lecture provides conditions on instruments and control variables under which external instrument methods produce valid inference on dynamic causal effects, that is, structural impulse response function; these conditions can help guide the search for valid instruments in applications. We consider two methods, a one-step instrumental variables regression and a two-step method that entails estimation of a vector autoregression. Under a restrictive instrument validity condition, the one-step method is valid even if the vector autoregression is not invertible, so comparing the two estimates provides a test of invertibility. Under a less restrictive condition, in which multiple lagged endogenous variables are needed as control variables in the one-step method, the conditions for validity of the two methods are the same.},

abstract = {Financial globalisation has given international capital flows a central role in the functioning of the global economy and has therefore led to considerable economic research over the past 30 years. Making the most of capital flows by allowing countries to reap their benefits while reducing associated risks has always been a challenge. This challenge became however even more acute in the past decade: following the Global Financial Crisis new concerns have indeed emerged related to the complexity of global financial relations, their role in shock transmission as well the ability of fundamentals to protect countries from financial instability. Against this background, recent research has focused on understanding better the implications of financial globalisation for economic stability and the design of policies. This literature review assesses these recent developments. After reviewing the most important trends in capital flows over the past decade, it takes stock of the discussion on the role of the global financial cycle in driving cross- border capital flows and financial instability, reviews the new findings on the real impact of international capital flows on recipient economies, and provides an overview of the ongoing debates on the role of capital controls and the need for policy coordination.},
annote = {The author reviews the recent literature on capital flows and divides it in the following categories: decoupling of gross and net flows, vulnerabilities due to the rise in EME corporate debt, the global financial cycle, recent evidence on the real impact of capital flows, capital flows management, and international coordination of policies.

Capital flows pose both benefits and vulnerabilities. Capital flows have increased considerably over the last 2 decades.

Important gaps identified in the paper are the dynamics of outflows, vulnerabilities of NCF foreign borrowing, comparison of capital flow management databases.

Highlights importance of studying the drivers of capital flows and not treatment them only as residuals of current account imbalances, and to supplement the analysis of those imbalances for monitoring purposes.

But not only focus on its size but its composition, despite current data gaps.

Describes research studying the situation of NFC foreign borrowing (carry trade, no hedging, off-shore financing).

Summarizes push-pull factors: they vary across time and countries; push more important for portfolio flows and during crisis, while pull more important for bank flows/FDI and in 'normal' times.

New research focus on the mechanisms by which push factors affect EMEs and their sensitivity to them (i.e. based on fundamentals). The more related and relevant part to my research is that of the global factors identified using factor models and their influence to capital flows. As well the part on the global credit cycle. Research needed on the recepients of capital flows and outflows, trade and balance-sheet channels of the exchange rate.

Capital flows can lead to misallocations.

The resulting FCIs are broadly similar. They both have some forecasting power for monthly GDP in a quasi-real-time recursive evaluation from 2011–14 and outperform an FCI produced by Goldman Sachs. A second factor, that may be interpreted as a monetary conditions index, adds further forecast power, while third factors have a mixed effect on performance. The FCIs are used to improve identification of credit supply shocks in an SVAR. The main effects relative to an SVAR excluding an FCI of the (adverse) credit shock IRFs are to make the positive impact on inflation more precise and to reveal an increased positive impact on spreads.},

This is true of both formal analytical models and historical narratives. This approach may be reasonable when financial markets are highly segmented. But it is badly inadequate when they are closely integrated, as they have been most of the time since at least the second half of the 19th century. Zeroing on the capital account shifts the focus from the goods markets to asset markets and balance sheets. Seen through this lens, the IMFS looks quite different. Its main weakness is its propensity to amplify financial surges and collapses that generate costly financial crises - its "excess financial elasticity". And assessing the vulnerabilities it hides requires going beyond the residence/non-resident distinction that underpins the balance of payments to look at the consolidated balance sheets of the decision units that straddle national borders, be these banks or non-financial companies. We illustrate these points by revisiting two defining historical phases in which financial meltdowns figured prominently, the interwar years and the more recent Great Financial Crisis},

After reviewing two mature applications of DFMs, forecasting and macroeconomic monitoring, the chapter lays out the use of DFMs for analysis of structural shocks, a special case of which is factor-augmented vector autoregressions (FAVARs). A main focus of the chapter is how to extend methods for identifying shocks in structural vector autoregression (SVAR) to structural DFMs. The chapter provides a unification of SVARs, FAVARs, and structural DFMs and shows both in theory and through an empirical application to oil shocks how the same identification strategies can be applied to each type of model.},

Using a longer time series and broader country sample than previous studies, we con- firm that flows vary with uncertainty (VIX), US monetary policy (real interest rate and term spread), and US exchange rate. In contrast to the existing literature, we find that US bank conditions are insignificant in explaining flows outside the global financial crisis. European bank conditions (euro-area and UK large bank leverage, or TED spread, the three-month interbank rate minus three-month government bond yield) are, however, important throughout the 2000s, even outside the crisis and when controlling for commonality in global conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that global financial conditions are best captured by US monetary conditions and exchange rate dynamics and European bank conditions. This finding is consist- ent with the important role of European banks in intermediating cross-border credit, including dollar-denominated credit.},

abstract = {We study the conditional distribution of GDP growth as a function of economic and financial conditions. Deteriorating financial conditions are associated with an increase in conditional volatility and a decline in the conditional mean of GDP growth, leading to a highly skewed distribution. The lower quantiles of GDP growth exhibit strong variation as a function of financial conditions, while the upper quantiles are stable over time. Although measures of financial conditions have significant influence in forecasts of downside vulnerability, measures of economic conditions have significant predictive power only for the median of the distribution. These findings are robust both in and out of sample and to the inclusion of different measures of financial conditions. We quantify GDP vulnerability as relative entropy between the empirical conditional and unconditional distribution. We show that this measure of vulnerability is highly asymmetric: The contribution to the total relative entropy of the probability mass below the median of the conditional distribution is larger and more volatile than the contribution of the probability mass above the median. The asymmetric response of the distribution of GDP growth to financial and economic conditions—with adverse financial conditions increasing downside vulnerability of growth but not the median forecast—is challenging for standard models of the macroeconomy. We argue that the inclusion of a financial sector is crucial for generating the observed dynamics of growth vulnerability. Keywords:},

As a consequence, MIDAS regressions might be less efficient, but could also be less prone to parameter estimation error and/or specification errors. We examine how MIDAS regressions and Kalman filters match up under ideal circumstances, that is in population, and in cases where all the stochastic processes—low and high frequency—are correctly specified. We characterize cases where the MIDAS regression exactly replicates the steady state Kalman filter weights. We compare MIDAS and Kalman filter forecasts in population where the state space model is misspecified. We also compare MIDAS and Kalman filter forecasts in small samples.

We provide asymptotic multistage standard errors necessary to conduct inference for asset pricing tests. We illustrate our new estimators in an application to the joint pricing of stocks and bonds.

The results show that, despite recent structural and regulatory changes, much of it survives. FDI inflows are more stable than non-FDI inflows. Within non-FDI inflows, portfolio debt and bank-intermediated flows remain the most volatile. While FDI inflows are driven mainly by pull factors, portfolio debt and equity are driven mainly by push factors; and bank-intermediated flows are driven by a combination of push and pull factors. But capital outflows from emerging markets behave differ- ently. FDI outflows from emerging markets have grown and become significantly more volatile. There is similarly an increase in the volatility of bank-intermediated capital outflows from emerging markets. The findings under- score that outflows from emerging markets, both FDI and bank-related flows, have come to play a growing role and warrant greater attention from analysts and policy makers.},

We find that since the pre-crisis period, gross capital inflows recov- ered more for economies with smaller pre-crisis external and internal imbalances, lower per capita income, improving growth expectations, a less severe impact of the global financial crisis and less stringent macroprudential policy. On the asset side, countries with a more accommodative monetary policy, a milder impact of the crisis and oil exporters managed to increase gross capital outflows in the post-crisis period.},

abstract = {The financial market turmoil in 2007 and 2008 has led to the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression and threatens to have large repercussions on the real economy. The bursting of the housing bubble forced banks to write down several hundred billion dollars in bad loans caused by mortgage delinquencies. At the same time, the stock market capitalization of the major banks declined by more than twice as much. While the overall mortgage losses are large on an absolute scale, they are still relatively modest compared to the {\$}8 trillion of U.S. stock market wealth lost between October 2007, when the stock market reached an all-time high, and October 2008. This paper attempts to explain the economic mechanisms that caused losses in the mortgage market to amplify into such large dislocations and turmoil in the financial markets, and describes common economic threads that explain the plethora of market declines, liquidity dry-ups, defaults, and bailouts that occurred after the crisis broke in summer 2007.

We show that on-balance sheet syndicated loan exposures, which account for almost one third of total cross-border loan exposures, increased during the global financial crisis due to large drawdowns on credit lines extended before the crisis. Our empirical analysis of the drivers of cross-border loan exposures in a large bilateral dataset leads to three main results. First, banks with lower levels of capital favor syndicated over other kinds of cross-border loans. Second, borrower country characteristics such as level of development, economic size, and capital account openness, are less important in driving syndicated than non-syndicated loan activity, suggesting a diversification motive for syndication. Third, information asymmetries between lender and borrower countries became more binding for both types of cross-border lending activity during the recent crisis.},
