  abstract =      {EXECUTIVE SUMMARY At the Cannes Summit in 2011, the
                   G20 launched an initiative to prepare an action plan
                   for the development of local currency bond markets
                   (LCBMs). Since then, the IMF and the World Bank have
                   produced brief joint notes that take stock of recent
                   LCBM developments. This Note summarizes key trends
                   and developments in LCBMs since June 2018 and reports
                   on the work of international organizations in
                   promoting LCBMs. Emerging Market (EM) LCBMs have
                   continued their growth, with significant issuance of
                   local currency debt. The total stock of EM debt
                   securities rose by USD 2.2 trillion to USD 25.9
                   trillion in 2018. The share of EM debt in local
                   currency stood at 85 percent in 2018 (USD 22.4
                   trillion). LCBMs continued to be dominated by Asia,
                   with increasing market growth in China. Regional
                   growth is also apparent in the Middle East, while a
                   few markets Africa are maturing. Many emerging (EM)
                   and low-income countries (LICs) continue to rely on
                   external issuance, or on foreign investors to
                   purchase local-currency denominated debt, for
                   government financing. Issuance of Eurobonds has
                   continued at high levels, as sovereigns have
                   continued to take advantage of the low global
                   interest rate environment. Holdings of EM local
                   currency government bonds by foreign investors
                   declined slightly in 2018, to around 19 percent on
                   average. Liquidity in many EM government bond markets
                   has improved reflecting progress in LCBM development
                   and in many cases a broadening of the investor base.
                   Inclusion in global bond market indices has helped to
                   improve government bond market liquidity and attract
                   various types of new investors across markets.
                   However, bid-ask spreads for EMs generally remain
                   higher than those in advanced economies (AEs) and
                   many EM countries continue to point to limited
                   secondary bond market liquidity as a challenge.},

                   findings are as follows. First, domestic debt
                   accounts for almost two-thirds of public debt.
                   Second, the data help to explain the puzzle of why
                   countries default on external debts at seemingly low
                   debt thresholds. Third, domestic debt (which is often
                   larger than the monetary base in the run-up to high
                   inflation) has largely been ignored in the inflation

                   market sovereign borrowing and a rapidly growing
                   share of foreign holding of emerging market debt. We
                   introduce a new measure of local currency sovereign
                   risk, the local currency credit spread, defined as
                   the yield spread of a local currency bond over the
                   local currency risk-free rate implied from cross
                   currency swaps. From a dollar investor's perspective,
                   this measure gives the synthetic dollar spread on
                   holding a local currency bond after fully hedging the
                   currency risk of promised cash flows. Compared with
                   the traditional measure of sovereign risk based on
                   credit spreads on foreign currency denominated debt,
                   we find that local currency credit spreads have lower
                   means, are less correlated across countries and less
                   sensitive to global risk factors. We develop a model
                   of partially segmented domestic and external
                   sovereign debt markets and test the model's
                   differential predictions for the risk premium and the
                   term structure of credit spreads on the two types of
                   debt. We find that imperfect market integration via
                   risky credit arbitrage is important for the
                   differential pricing of local and foreign currency

                   This yield compression comes from a reduction in the
                   credit risk premium. Crucially, the relevant exchange
                   rate involved in yield compression is the bilateral

                   financial crises that originated in developed
                   countries, emerging market countries have played a
                   crucial role in the transmission of sovereign credit

                   Secondary regressions show that both trade and
                   capital flows are important determinants of pairwise
                   connectedness across countries. The capital flows
                   became increasingly important after 2013, while the

                   effective than LSAPs at moving short-term Treasury
                   yields, while LSAPs were more effective than forward
                   guidance and the federal funds rate at moving
                   longer-term Treasury and corporate bond yields. The
                   effects of forward guidance announcements tend to die
                   out over time, probably at least partly because those
                   announcements have horizons of only a few quarters.
                   In contrast, the effects of LSAP announcements seem

                   to short-term rates represents a puzzle for standard
                   macro-finance models. We find that post-FOMC
                   announcement drift in Treasury markets after Fed
                   Funds target changes contributes to this excess
                   sensitivity of long rates. The expectations
                   hypothesis holds on FOMC announcement days, but fails
                   thereafter. Mutual fund investors respond to Fed
                   Funds target rate increases by selling short and
                   intermediate duration bond funds, thus gradually
                   increasing the effective supply of these bonds. Using
                   FOMC-induced variation in bond fund flows, we
                   estimate short-run demand for Treasurys to be
                   inelastic, especially for longer maturities. The
                   gradual increase in supply, combined with the low
                   demand elasticity, account for the post-announcement
                   drift in Treasurys, which then spreads to other bond
                   markets. Our findings shed new light on the causes of

                   policy announcement surprises on foreign equity
                   indexes, short- and long-term interest rates, and
                   exchange rates in 49 countries. We use two proxies
                   for monetary policy surprises: the surprise change to
                   the current target federal funds rate (target
                   surprise) and the revision to the expected path of
                   future monetary policy (path surprise). We find that
                   different asset classes respond to different
                   components of the monetary policy surprises. Global
                   equity indexes respond mainly to the target surprise;
                   exchange rates and long-term interest rates respond
                   mainly to the path surprise; and short-term interest
                   rates respond to both surprises. On average, a
                   hypothetical surprise 25-basis-point cut in the
                   federal funds target rate is associated with about a
                   1 percent increase in foreign equity indexes and a 5
                   basis point decline in foreign short-term interest
                   rates. A surprise 25-basis-point downward revision in
                   the expected path of future policy is associated with
                   about a 1/2 percent decline in the exchange value of
                   the dollar against foreign currencies and 5 and 8
                   basis point declines in short- and long-term interest
                   rates, respectively. We also find that asset prices'
                   responses to FOMC announcements vary greatly across
                   countries, and that these cross-country variations in
                   the response are related to a country's exchange rate
                   regime. Equity indexes and interest rates in
                   countries with a less flexible exchange rate regime
                   respond more to U.S. monetary policy surprises. In
                   addition, the cross-country variation in the equity
                   market response is strongly related to the percentage
                   of each country's equity market capitalization owned
                   by U.S. investors. This result suggests that
                   investors' asset holdings may play a role in
                   transmitting monetary policy surprises across
                   countries. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

                   banks on a typical small open economy that follows

                   replicate the key empirical facts on emerging

                   international spillovers of conventional and balance-
                   sheet policies undertaken by the Federal Reserve and
                   European Central Bank. In principle, conventional
                   monetary policy affects bond yields and financial
                   conditions by affecting the expected path of short
                   rates, while balance-sheet policy is believed act
                   through the term premium. To distinguish the effects
                   of these two types of policies we use a term
                   structure model to decompose longer-term bond yields
                   into expected short-term interest rates and term
                   premiums. We then examine the relative effects of
                   changes in these two components of yields on changes
                   in exchange rates and foreign bond yields. We find
                   that the sensitivity of the dollar to monetary policy
                   announcements has risen since the GFC, and most of
                   this rise owes to an increased sensitivity of the
                   dollar to expected interest rates rather than to term
                   premiums. We also find that changes in short rates
                   and term premiums have similar effects on foreign
                   yields. Our findings contradict the popular view that
                   quantitative easing exerts greater international
                   spillovers than conventional monetary policies. 1},

  abstract =      {We show significant US monetary policy (MP)
                   spillovers to international bond markets. Our
                   methodology identifies US MP shocks as the change in
                   short-term Treasury yields around Federal Open Market
                   Committee meetings and traces their effects on
                   international bond yields using panel regressions. We
                   emphasize three main results. First, US MP spillovers
                   to long-term yields have increased substantially
                   after the 2007–2009 global financial crisis.
                   Second, spillovers are large compared with the
                   effects of other events, and at least as large as the
                   effects of domestic MP after 2008. Third, spillovers
                   work through different channels, concentrated in
                   risk-neutral rates (expectations of future MP rates)
                   for developed countries, but predominantly on term
                   premia in emerging markets. In interpreting these
                   findings, we provide evidence consistent with an
                   exchange rate channel, according to which foreign
                   central banks face a trade-off between narrowing MP
                   rate differentials or experiencing currency movements
                   against the US dollar. Developed countries adjust in
                   a manner consistent with freely floating regimes,
                   responding partially with risk-neutral rates and
                   partially through currency adjustments. Instead,
                   emerging countries display patterns consistent with
                   foreign exchange interventions, which cushion the
                   response of exchange rates but reinforce capital
                   flows and their effects in bond yields through
                   movements in term premia. Our results suggest that
                   the endogenous effects of currency interventions on
                   long-term yields should be added into the standard
                   cost-benefit analysis of such policies.},

                   bonds are highly responsive to U.S. monetary policy
                   surprises—during both the conventional and
                   unconventional policy regimes—and that the
                   passthrough of unconventional policy to foreign bond
                   yields is, on balance, comparable to that of
                   conventional policy. In addition, a conventional U.S.
                   monetary easing (tightening) leads to a significant
                   narrowing (widening) of credit spreads on sovereign
                   bonds issued by countries with a speculative-grade
                   credit rating but has no effect on the corresponding
                   weighted average of bilateral exchange rates for a
                   basket of currencies from the same set of risky
                   countries; this indicates that an unanticipated
                   tightening of U.S. monetary policy widens credit
                   spreads on risky sovereign debt directly through the
                   financial channel, as opposed to indirectly through
                   the exchange rate channel. During the unconventional
                   policy regime, yields on both investment- and
                   speculative-grade sovereign bonds move one-to-one
                   with policy-induced fluctuations in yields on
                   comparable U.S. Treasuries. We also examine whether
                   the response of sovereign credit spreads to US
                   monetary policy differs between policy easings and
                   tightenings and find no evidence of such asymmetry.},

                   fills that void by making public the Treasury yield
                   curve estimates of the Federal Reserve Board at a
                   daily frequency from 1961 to the present. We use a

                   uncertainty. Our U.S. index spikes near tight
                   presidential elections, Gulf Wars I and II, the 9/11
                   attacks, the failure of Lehman Brothers, the 2011
                   debt ceiling dispute, and other major battles over
                   fiscal policy. Using firm-level data, we find that
                   policy uncertainty is associated with greater stock
                   price volatility and reduced investment and
                   employment in policy-sensitive sectors like defense,
                   health care, finance, and infrastructure
                   construction. At the macro level, innovations in
                   policy uncertainty foreshadow declines in investment,
                   output, and employment in the United States and, in a
                   panel vector autoregressive setting, for 12 major
                   economies. Extending our U.S. index back to 1900, EPU
                   rose dramatically in the 1930s (from late 1931) and
                   has drifted upward since the 1960s.},

                   world real economic activity derived from shipping
                   costs. This measure turns out to depend on a
                   normalization that has substantive consequences, of
                   which users of the index had been unaware prior to
                   this paper. This paper further evaluates this and
                   alternative measures in terms of treatment of trends,
                   coherence with world output, and correlation with
                   commodity prices. I conclude that measures derived
                   from world industrial production offer a better
                   indicator of global real economic activity.},

                   changes in the target funds rate into anticipated and

                   with the expectations hypothesis of the term

                   effect on expectations of future actions, however,
                   which helps to explain the lack of empirical support

                   responses without specification and estimation of the
                   underlying multivariate dynamic system. The central
                   idea consists in estimating local projections at each
                   period of interest rather than extrapolating into
                   increasingly distant horizons from a given model, as
                   it is done with vector autoregressions (VAR). The
                   advantages of local projections are numerous: (1)
                   they can be estimated by simple regression techniques
                   with standard regression packages; (2) they are more
                   robust to misspecification; (3) joint or point-wise
                   analytic inference is simple; and (4) they easily
                   accommodate experimentation with highly nonlinear and
                   flexible specifications that may be impractical in a
                   multivariate context. Therefore, these methods are a
                   natural alternative to estimating impulse responses
                   from VARs. Monte Carlo evidence and an application to
                   a simple, closed-economy, new-Keynesian model clarify
                   these numerous advantages.},

  year =          {2014},
  abstract =      {This paper provides evidence that interbank markets
                   are tiered rather than flat, in the sense that most
                   banks do not lend to each other directly but through
                   money center banks acting as intermediaries. We
                   capture the concept of tiering by developing a
                   core-periphery model, and devise a procedure for
                   fitting the model to real-world networks. Using
                   Bundesbank data on bilateral interbank exposures
                   among 2000 banks from 1999 to 2012, we find strong
                   evidence of tiering in the German banking system.
                   This extent of tiering is unlikely to arise in
                   standard random networks. Indeed, we show that bank
                   specialization and balance sheet variables predict
                   how banks position themselves in the interbank
                   market. This link provides a promising avenue for
                   understanding the formation of financial networks.
