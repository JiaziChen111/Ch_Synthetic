		\textbf{\Large Data Appendix}\\
		\medskip
		Pavel Solís, "Name of Paper"
	\end{center}

	The Data Appendix provides information about all the variables in your \textbf{analysis data files}, such as their names, definitions, coding (for all variables), and summary statistics and histograms (for quantitative variables), and relative frequency tables and charts (for categorical variables).
	
	The Data Appendix serves as a codebook and users' guide for \underline{your} \textbf{analysis data files}.
	
	You should construct your Data Appendix \underline{as soon as you have finished} writing the \textbf{command files} that create your \textbf{analysis data files}.
	
	When you construct your Data Appendix, you are likely to learn things about your data that you should know before you begin your analysis. So you should not begin the analysis until after you have constructed your Data Appendix.\footnote{Andy Rose (Notes for Efficient Data Organization/Handling, 2017): Check your data sets by graphing and looking for outliers. Look for outliers through descriptive statistics (e.g., look for stuff that lies a few standard errors beyond the mean). Time series plots (of both levels and growth rates) are great for time series. Always provide descriptive statistics right before you do any serious empirical work.}\\
