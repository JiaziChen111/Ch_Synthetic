\section{Trend Inflation as a Proxy for Long-Term Inflation Forecasts} \label{sec:trendinf}
\setcounter{figure}{0}

An advantage of the small open economy approach is that it only requires forecasts for inflation, or a proxy in the case of countries with no long-term forecasts available as is the case for Israel and South Africa.

Inflation expectations are hoped to match measures of inflation that exclude unexpected shocks and better reflect the inflation environment.
Different measures of core inflation exist.
I use the inflation trend obtained by applying the Hodrick-Prescott filter to the series of realized inflation of each country.
Of course, the filter is sensitive to the sample period used.
The resulting trend can also be outside of the target inflation band due to the innate dynamics of the series, which would be at odds with survey data (see figure \ref{fig:wnCPI}).

%Fortunately, u
Unlike other countries, there is no marked upward or downward trend in the inflation of Israel nor South Africa during the sample period.
For each country, trend inflation is calculated for the whole period but only considered within the time range for which survey data is available for the rest of the countries, and as long as the trend is within the inflation target band.

Figure \ref{fig:CPI_ILSZAR} shows the realized and trend inflation for Israel and South Africa, and compares them with those of Malaysia and Thailand, two countries with a similar pattern for inflation (i.e. no marked trend) and for which survey data is available.
%It supports that t
Trend inflation seems to be a good proxy for the long-term inflation forecasts of Israel and South Africa.
Finally, since the 5-year and long-term forecasts closely follow each other (see figure \ref{fig:wnCPI}), I use trend inflation for both tenors.

\section{Connectedness of Yield Components}
\setcounter{figure}{0}

%The expected short rate in emerging markets reacts to changes in the U.S. term premium. 
%This is consistent with the U.S. risk spillovers channel described by \cite{Kalemli-Ozcan:2019}.

%Here, I exploit it to provide new stylized facts about them that will help to interpret the results in the next section.
%To some extent, the response of emerging market yields to U.S. monetary policy shocks depends on 
%%how integrated are LC bonds to the global financial markets.
%%This requires to answer the question of 
%how connected are the sovereign yields of emerging markets.
%One way to address this question is to pool all yields together and see whether there is a global-level factor, associated with the first principal component.
%A global factor explains more than 90\% of the variation in the yields of advanced countries, 
%%consistent with \cite{DahlquistHasseltoft:2016}, 
%whereas it only explains around 50\% of the variation in the yields of emerging markets. % or their components.
%\footnote{ \cite{DuSchreger:2016JoF} find something similar for the credit risk compensation.}
%This suggests that the emerging market yields are not as connected among themselves as the yields of advanced countries.
%When yields are separated by maturity, a similar pattern emerges for the 1-year yields, whereas for the 10-year yields, a global factor explains around 95\% in AEs and 40\% in EMs. 
%Although a global factor plays a role in the variation of yields in both AEs and EMs, the bond yields in EMs are not as tightly connected as they are in AEs.
%These percentages are largely the same after the GFC.
%A global factor explains around 40\% of the variation of all the three components of yields in EMs.\footnote{ \cite{DuSchreger:2016JoF} also show that the credit risk compensation has a low reaction to global variables.} 
%For AEs, in contrast, a global factor explains 90\% of the variation in the expected short rate and 80\% in their term premia. 
%After the GFC, these percentages **increased** for the term premia in AEs and for the two components of the synthetic yields in EMs.

%A more formal way to analyze the comovement of %emerging market 
%%answer the question 
%yields is to measure the degree of connectedness among them.
%; that is, how much does the shock in one market has implications for the other markets.
%\cite{DieboldYilmaz:2014} propose a system-wide measure of connectedness 
%%based on forecast error variance decompositions.
%%Their methodology 
%that assesses shares of forecast error variation in a country's bond market due to shocks arising elsewhere.
%The connectedness index fluctuates between 0 and 100 percent, with higher numbers indicating a higher degree of comovement.
%Following \cite{ACDM:2019} and \cite{BostanciYilmaz:2020}, I obtain the connectedness index using a vector autoregression of order 1, with a forecast horizon of 10 days and a rolling window of 150 days for the daily changes of the 10-year nominal yield
%%of the emerging markets in the sample 
%and each of its components.

Figure \ref{fig:dyindex10y} shows that the connectedness index for the yields of emerging markets fluctuates around 30\%, %and advanced countries.

%, with potential implications for some of the emerging markets in the sample.
%By mid-2017, the index was back to its pre-taper tantrum levels of around 30\% compared to an average value of the index for advanced countries of close to 70\%.
%The difference between the 
In contrast, \cite{ACDM:2019} report that the index fluctuates around 80\% for advanced countries.

The evidence of highly connected yields in advanced countries and low connected yields in emerging markets %might seem at odds with the idea of a 
%perspective based on the 
%global financial cycle \citep{Rey:2013}.
%On the one hand, the yields of advanced countries are highly connected among themselves (see figure \ref{subfig:dyindex10yAE}), which over the last decade has been driven by an increase in the connectedness of their term premia, as documented by \cite{ACDM:2019}.
%Changes in the compensation for risk in one advanced country not only spillover to other advanced countries but they have become increasingly important for the variation in their yields.
%On the other hand, the yields among emerging markets are not as connected as those in advanced countries (see figure \ref{subfig:dyindex10ydcmp}).
%The level of the index for emerging markets is about half the level of the index for advanced countries, it shows no upward trend for either their nominal yields or their components.\footnote{ \cite{ACDM:2019} already document that the increase in the connectedness of the yields of advanced countries has been driven by an increase in the connectedness of their term premia.}
% of emerging market yields do not show a clear trend, their relative importance seems to depend on the current economic environment.
%as might be expected under a perspective based on the global financial cycle. %according to the idea of the

%Unlike the rise in the connectedness of the term premium among advanced countries,

is consistent with a view %the global financial cycle 
in which global bond markets essentially operate under a core-periphery structure, in which the bond markets of advanced countries constitute the (highly interconnected) core and those of emerging markets represent the (less connected) periphery.
Countries in the periphery are in turn connected to the network mainly through countries in the core.\footnote{ The core-periphery structure has been shown to be a good description of different networks in economics and finance.} % \cite{CvP:2014} show, for example, that the interbank market operates under such a structure.
According to this view, shocks to emerging market yields are mainly idiosyncratic---reflected in less comovement---so
%figures \ref{subfig:dyindex10ydcmp} and \ref{subfig:dyindex10yAE} are measuring the connectedness of the periphery and the core, respectively.
%Therefore,

%, which makes the argument of a global financial cycle stronger, not weaker.

The connectedness index for the yields of emerging markets shows no clear trend for either the nominal or synthetic yields nor their components. 
In contrast, \cite{ACDM:2019} document that the increase in the connectedness of the yields of advanced countries has been driven by an increase in the connectedness of their term premia.
Nevertheless, the term premia in emerging markets has been slightly more connected since 2013, whereas the credit risk compensation is relatively less connected (see figure \ref{subfig:dyindex10ydcmp}).
In fact, the level of the index for the synthetic yields tends to be higher than that for the nominal yields (see figure \ref{subfig:dyindex10ynomsyn}), suggesting that credit risk is indeed a more idiosyncratic component of the yields.

%Are the short and long end equally connected?

%A related question is whether the connectedness of yields is the same throughout the term structure or whether some sections of the curves are more connected than others.
%%The role of a global factor seems to be different throughout the yield curve.
%\cite{Obstfeld:2015} 
%%shows that the effects of the global financial cycle are different at the short than at the long end of the yield curve. In particular, he 
%argues that long-term bonds are more globally connected than short term ones.
%On the other hand, \cite{Kalemli-Ozcan:2019} argues that short-term yields suffer more the effects of global influences.
%When yields are separated by maturity, a global factor explains around 50\% of the variation in the 1-year yields of EMs, compared to 90\% for AEs. 
%For the 10-year yields, a global factor explains around 60\% of the variability in EMs, relative to 95\% in AEs. 
%However, the role of the global factor is larger for the two components of the synthetic yield curve in the long end than for the short end.
%In sum, the role of a global component is larger for long-term yields and its components.
%Figure \ref{fig:dy_index_ts} plots the connectedness index for different maturities.
%It shows that the long end is relatively more connected than the short end, similar to what is observed for advanced countries, although this pattern became relevant for emerging markets after the taper tantrum episode.
%The figure also shows that the connectedness of the short end of the yield curves is similar between advanced and emerging markets.
%The difference in connectedness between the two groups of countries is therefore driven by the medium and long end of their yield curves.
%Although foreign participation in LC bond markets has increased, it is still mostly held by local investors, especially medium- and longer-term bonds as suggested by figure \ref{fig:dy_index_ts}, 
%%of emerging markets are far from being fully integrated in the global financial markets 
%and are therefore more responsive to local factors.
%In sum, while the yields of emerging markets are indeed globally connected, they are less so than the yields of advanced countries. 
%In particular, 
%Several factors can explain these patterns, including segmented markets, capital controls, home bias and regional differences.
%therefore seem to play a bigger role in the yields of EMs, and its components, than they do for AEs.

Finally, notice that the low connectedness among the yields of emerging markets supports estimating the term structure models for their yield curves separately (as it has been done in the paper) rather than jointly.
