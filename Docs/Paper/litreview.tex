EM have increased its issuance of sovereign debt in local currency (DS 2016, Ottonello and Perez 2019)

Default risk for EMs is non-negligible (DS 2018, Galli 2020)

Theoretical explanations for positive default risk in LC (when government lacks commitment to repay and to not inflate)
- Large amounts of private external debt (DS 2016)
- in bad times, incentive to use inflation to smooth public spending increases along with default probability (Galli 2020)
- GDP is more volatile in EMs

Rationalize recent surge in LC borrowing (DS 2016, Engel and Park 2018, Ottonello and Perez 2019)

Sovereign defaults are generally followed by episodes of abnormally high inflation (Na et al. 2018; Reinhart and Rogoff 2009, 2011)

Na et al. (2018) rationalize the joint occurrence of defaults and large currency devaluations: after a default, it is optimal to devalue the currency when wages are sticky to reduce the real value of wages and stimulate the economy.

Galli (2020): 
Inflation and default risks co-move
Default and currency premia are positively correlated
Inflation has a dual purpose, it dilutes the real value of external debt (tax on foreign lenders) and of domestic money (tax on domestic money holdings).
Inflation is a source of fiscal revenues.
When the demand for public goods is sufficiently inelastic, the incentive to use the inflation to smooth public spending (the tax motive) is strong.

International sovereign yields of AEs: Driessen, Melenberg and Nijman (2003), Diebold, Li and Yue (2008), Wright (2011), Jotikasthira, Le and Lundblad (2015), Dahlquist and Hasseltoft (2016), ACDM (2019)

Decomposition of international yields of AEs: Wright (2011), ACDM (2019)

==============================================

Wright (2011)
Global TP has declined since mid 90s.
Decline is associated with a reduction in inflation uncertainty.
Inflation uncertainty is an important driver of term premiums.

Diebold, Li and Yue (2008)
Global yield curve factors linked to global macroeconomic factors such as inflation and real activity.

Curcuru, Kamin, Li \& Rodriguez (2018)
FX is more sensitive to ST than to TP, especially post-GFC.
- The effect of TP on FX appears to be post-GFC.
Foreign yields:
- For AEs, changes in ST and TP have similar effects.
- For Brazil, Canada and Mexico, effect of ST is greater than TP.
Foreign yields became more sensitive to US MP post-GFC, especially to ST.
UMP does not exert greater international spillovers than CMP.
CMP and UMP affect both ST and TP, but CMP mainly affects ST while UMP mainly affects TP.
Effects of ST exert effects at least as large as TP, especially post-GFC [why to both?] -> Challenges faced by foreign economies not entirely due to QE.
Policy easings by the Fed lead to substantial declines in German TP and vice versa: portfolio rebalancing and/or expectations of foreign easing.
-----
Decomposition for YCs of Brazil and Mexico provide further insights of the effects?


Adrian, Crump, Durham \& Moench (2019)
* Sovereign yield curves comove strongly since 90s
* Comovement and spillovers more pronounced post-GFC.
- Comovements (covariance, connectedness, tail dependence) in sovereign yields primarily due to TP.
- Global yields react strongly to US target shocks (panel local projections), w/ a substantial lag primarily via a reassessment of global policy rate expectations.
- US ST -> global ST, US TP -> global TP. Consistent w/ Curcuru et al. (2018)
Factor structure of global TP is stronger than ST and has been increasing since GFC.
Connectedness is primarily driven by TP.
ST of global yields strongly responds to US target shocks but w/ considerable delay.
Prominent role of TP in explaining yield variation: common trend in interest rate risk compensation + substantial proportion of yield variation.
Secular decline in TP variance increasingly accounted for a greater proportion of lower yield variance.
- Secular decline in TP due to inflation uncertainty (Wright 2011).
- Decline in TP is not restricted to the largest economies (also in other AEs and EMs).
TP account for more of the variation in yields since mid-90s.
- Due to SR (flight to quality) or LR (perceptions of interest rate risk -> attitudes toward CB commitments to LR goals) shocks to TP?
HF cycles account for more of the variance and covariance in US yields.
- Is it due to ST or TP? HF cycles account for considerably more variation in the YC components. HF share for TP closely follows HF share in yields. LF cycles account for more variation in TP. 
Increase in TP share of lower variance coincides w/ increase in LF power for diminished variation in risk preferences.
Decreasing contribution of ST to variance coincides w/ elevated HF power -> Investors absorbed news about the path of policy rates more quickly over the last two decades.
- Is there a global trend?

A large fraction of the monthly covariation of sovereign yield curves is due to global term premium comovement.
Global YCs have comoved strongly sin late 90s, decline during GFC. Comovement picked up again around 2013 driven by increase in TP correlation in part b/c global TP comove strongly w/ US TP.
Global YC connectedness has been elevated since 2000, decline in GFC.
ST and TP components connected to similar extent until 2007. ST connectedness declined since GFC. TP connectedness declined in GFC and picked up again around 2010 to levels not seen before -> Innovations in TP have become more important for the variation of local sovereign yields.
Tail dependence: sharp movements in one bond market spill over into other bond markets.
Secular decline in tail dependence since 2001. Increase in tail dependence since 2013 mainly driven by TP -> Risk attitudes of global bond investors might be a source of comovement in tail events.
- Tail dependence in yields is higher b/w countries in the same economic region.
- Tail dependence for the TP has increased sharply -> Sudden jumps in TP have become more synchronized across countries.

Increased correlation and synchronized jumps in yields -> diversification has become increasingly difficult.
The component of yields relevant for optimization is expected excess returns, which is related to TP (unobserved).
HF cycle share of TP variation declined recently while share of LF cycle increased -> tighter covariance among expected returns may reflect LF phenomena (LSAP, MP goals: IT), which has implications for investors w/ longer investment horizons (may not be well-diversified).

Propagation of MP shocks
Since comovement, spillover, tail dependence, MP international spillovers?
Response of global yields to US target shocks is strongly increasing w/ horizon. Delayed and protracted response of global yields to US target shocks (more than 1-to-1 w/ a substantial delay). 
Due to expectations of further Fed tightening or repricing of interest rate risk (higher TP)? 
ST increase strongly and persistently in response to a Fed tightening -> Investors expect global CB to follow Fed's decision (not due to FX movements).
Sharp reaction of global yields to US target shocks is driven by a reassessment of global policy rate expectations (ST) not by a repricing of global interest rate risk (TP).
US path and TP shocks lead to substantial adjustments of global yields through TP components.

Alternative lens for the propagation: Betas estimated in the frequency domain help determine extent to which lead-lag relationships persist. 
If shocks are sluggish and gather momentum, LF should have meaningful power to explain covariance b/w front and back end of YC.
- Betas of ST increase from HF to LF consistent w/ shocks being persistent (ST effect increasing w/ horizon) but modest contribution of LF to total variation (considerable HF noise in transmission toward the back of the YC).
- Betas of TP do not increase with frequency consistent w/ transmission from the US policy rate path to revisions in foreign anticipated policy paths (not revisions in TP).
- These mechanisms might not be very stable.


Dahlquist \& Hasseltoft (2016)
Excess return predictability and time-varying risk premia are two sides of the same coin.
Rational variation in risk premia arise from either: time-varyings economic risks or time-varying risk aversion among investors.
Future excess returns can be predictable even if markets are efficient: investors require higher risk premia during economic recessions.
The expectations hypothesis (zero or constant risk premia) is rejected in international data.
- The is significant time variation in international bond risk premia.
CP regressions predict excess returns across countries. 
- Predictive performance deteriorated in GFC. Reasons: UMP, fiscal policy uncertainty, time variation in funding and liquidity conditions, credit risk.
A global forecasting factor predicts local bond excess returns significantly -> commonality in risk premia across international bond markets.
- Global and systematic factors drive changes in the riskiness of nominal bonds.
Global factor is closely related to US bond risk premia -> US risk premia matter for international bond returns.
The dynamics of the global factor are countercyclical and predict future economic growth.
- A rise in global bond risk premia is contemporaneously associated with bad economic times but signals improved times ahead.
Bond risk premia turn negative during some periods.
Negative bond risk premia: nominal bonds act as hedging assets rather than risky assets.
No evidence of state dependency in bond markets: global factor predicts returns across business cycles (not only in recessions).
Nominal bonds are risky assets. Theoretical explanations of time variation in bond risk premia (predictable excess returns): habit formation generate time-varying investors' risk aversion (Buraschi and Jiltsov 2007), time-varying long-run economic risk model (Bansal and Shaliastovich 2013), model in which the severity of disaster risk varies over time (Gabaix 2012). (Piazzesi and Schneider 2009).
Portfolio rebalancing theory: changes in the supply of government debt affect the level and slope of the yield curve (Krishnamurty and Vissing-Jorgensen 2011, 2012). Preferred-habitat theory: increase supply of LT government debt steepens the yield curve and predicts excess returns on LT bonds (Greenwood and Vayanos 2014).

Channels through which macroeconomic shocks are transmitted across borders.
A world inflation factor drives risk compensation for long-term bonds.


Driessen, Melenberg and Nijman (2003)
A world level factor explains approximately 50\% of the variation in international bond returns.


Meldrum, Raczko and Spencer (2018)
Joint modelling does not bring any material benefits in capturing the dynamics of bond yields.
Joint models of US and German nominal yields do not offer economically significant advantages in fitting the cross-section of yields or predicting future yields. 
Joint models of US nominal and real yields do not offer economically significant advantages in fitting the cross-section of yields or predicting future yields.

Jeanneau and Tovar (2008): LA's LC bond markets - An Overview
there has been a significant change in the composition of government debt. Currency-linked debt has been phased out in a number of countries, including Brazil and Mexico, as part of debt management programmes aimed at reducing vulnerabilities to external shocks. In addition, the relative share of fixed rate debt has increased in most countries. Progress has been particularly notable in Mexico, where the share of fixed rate securities amounted to about 40\% at the end of 2005, versus less than 5\% in 2000. 
there has been a gradual extension of the maturity structure of government debt in
local currency. This has been achieved in part through a shift from short-term to fixed rate bonds and through a lengthening of the maturity of fixed rate bonds
The wider availability of longer-dated bonds is beginning to provide a useful
representation of the term structure of interest rates. Notwithstanding this progress in the region, the amount of fixed rate securities issued at longer tenors remains in most cases limited, as reflected in the relative stability of the weighted average maturity of new issues.
Secondary market trading in domestic bonds, a common measure of liquidity, has
expanded in recent years, but it remains low relative to mature markets. tightness of the market: efficiency with which market participants can trade. local markets for
fixed rate government securities do not appear to be very tight relative to the US market.
Indeed, bid-ask spreads, which provide an idea of the costs incurred by market participants in executing transactions, are significantly higher in Latin America (3-5bp) than in the United States (0.8-1.6 bp).

Kearns, Schrimpf and Xia (2018)
In support of the bond risk premium spillover channel, financial openness unambiguously emerges as the strongest factor in explaining the extent of the sensitivity of a country's interest rates to monetary policy shocks in major AEs.

Ramos-Francia and Santiago García-Verdú (2015)
the possibility of structural change in the policy rate, exchange rate, and long-term interest rate channels generally depends on the EME in question.
Results highlight the potential for a renewed interdependence between the monetary policies in most EMEs and US monetary policy. They also underscore the importance for most EMEs of taking appropriate policy measures, in particular as the United States begins tightening its monetary stance.
A better understanding of the international transmission of US monetary policy can therefore provide critical assistance to policy planning within EMEs.
For the exchange rate channel, the results depend on the specific EME as well. There is less evidence of possible structural changes in this channel across the battery of tests. Expected: EMEs have, for a relatively long time now, maintained a stationary inflationary
process (Noriega, Capistrán and Ramos-Francia (2013)), they have not monetized their fiscal deficits, ending fiscal dominance. This has produced a much lower pass-through.
The long-run interest rate channel also offers mixed evidence. the secular decrease in
long-term rates in the US that began in the early 1980s accelerated, given
the search-for-yield phenomenon, and was further supported by elements such as
US demographic dynamics and the implementation of UMP. In fact, the fall in the long-term rates in EMEs has been faster than their corresponding individual deflationary processes [indicating external influence].
In the long-run rate channel, other factors have surely played a role as well and thus have led to differing results among EMEs. For instance, some of these economies have implemented capital controls, established macroprudential policies, allowed credit booms, or had more flexibility in their fiscal policies. All in all, it would have been a surprise to observe uniform results for the long-term interest rate channel.

Carrillo,Rocio Elizondo,Rodríguez-Pérez and Roldán-Peña (2017)
Recent evidence shows that, in the last 25 years, the natural (or neutral) rate of interest of some advanced and emerging economies has followed a common downward trend, which suggests that there might be international factors behind the determination of equilibrium real interest rates worldwide. 
in almost all studies r* has followed a downward trend that started well before the global financial crisis, although it strengthen during the crisis.
Among relevant external factors, we find that foreign aggregate shocks, the instrumentation of monetary policy in advanced economies, and the gradual reduction in the global long-term real interest rate may explain recent trends in the Mexican natural rate of interest.

- the degree of capital mobility may differ between emerging and advanced countries. When capital mobility is strongly restricted, the changes in the interest rate may not affect capital flows and exchange rate in the standard way. For example, under capital account restrictions on capital inflows, the interest rate rise may not induce capital inflows and appreciate the exchange rate.
Schindler et al. (2015): stronger degrees of capital controls are imposed in emerging countries than in advanced countries.
- the degree of exchange rate flexibility does not explain the differences in the exchange rate responses between advanced and emerging countries.
- we don’t find any direct evidence that foreign exchange intervention plays some role
in generating the exchange rate puzzle in emerging countries.
- When the financial market is less developed, the standard monetary policy transmission mechanism may not work well. For example, when the bond market is less developed, an interest rate increase may not induce capital inflows into the bond market, and have a limited effect on exchange rate. the degree of financial market development does not seem to fully explain the difference in the effects of monetary policy on exchange rate.

Zero coupon defaultable bond seen as a portfolio of two securities: (1) security paying \$1 contingent on survival at maturity, (2) security that pays a recovery at default if it occurs before maturity
Reduced form models: price using a default-adjusted discount rate
Structural models: price of riskless zero coupon bond minus the value of a put option on the value of the firm
Only the timing of default is priced, assumes that recovery risk is not priced which would introduce a risk premium.
Market price of risk \(\Lambda\) of the j-th risk factor can be thought of as the price (per unit of volatility) of shocks to the j-th  risk factor.
\(\Lambda\) is the vector of risk premiums (volatility in the price induced by volatility in the risk factors) required for each unit of volatility of the N risk factors.
\(\Lambda\) is independent of the cash flow pattern of the security being priced and so is common to all securities with payoffs that are functions of the risk factors Y.
