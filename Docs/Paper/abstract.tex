	The	sovereign debt of advanced economies is generally considered free of default risk, which is key in the estimation of their term premia. The risk-free assumption, however, is not appropriate for the sovereign debt of emerging market economies. I use yield curves adjusted for credit risk in order to adequately estimate the term premia of 15 emerging markets. I find that the main component for the 10-year yield of emerging markets is the expected future path of the short-term interest rate, while for advanced economies the main component is the term premium. I also find that both global and domestic factors are important drivers of the term premia in emerging markets.
