	Estimation of term premia has focused on advanced economies in part because their sovereign debt is free of default risk. The risk-free assumption, however, is not appropriate for emerging market economies. I use yield curves adjusted for credit risk in order to adequately estimate the term premia in 15 emerging markets. The term premia is approximately 175 basis points on average. The analysis of their cyclical properties shows that both global and domestic factors are important drivers.
