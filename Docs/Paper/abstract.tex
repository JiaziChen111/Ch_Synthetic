\begin{abstract}
	This paper decomposes the sovereign bond yields of 15 emerging markets.
	Two common concerns in analyzing these yields are credit risk and small sample sizes.
	I overcome these concerns by using synthetic local currency yield curves to account for credit risk and survey forecasts to address the small sample problem.
	This allows me to decompose the bond yields into an expected future short-term interest rate, a term premium and a credit risk premium.
	I exploit this decomposition to analyze the dynamics of bond yields in emerging markets.
	First, these yields comove and their risk premia is time-varying.
	The comovement is mainly driven by the term premium, whose size more than doubles the credit risk premium.
	In fact, the term premia is more globally connected than the credit risk premia and the expected short rates.
	Further, the global component of term premia is highly linked to the U.S. term premia, whereas its idiosyncratic component is countercyclical. 
	Second, [a recent reduction in term premia owes in part to declining inflation uncertainty among emerging markets.]
	Finally, U.S. monetary policy shocks mainly affect component(s): [1, 2, 3].
