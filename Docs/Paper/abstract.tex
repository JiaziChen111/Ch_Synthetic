\begin{abstract}
	Estimation of term premia has focused on advanced economies in part because their sovereign debt is free of default risk. Such risk, however, is not absent in emerging market economies. This paper uses yield curves adjusted for default risk in order to adequately estimate the term premia in 15 emerging markets. These estimates are then compared with macroeconomic and financial variables to study the cyclical properties of the term premia.
