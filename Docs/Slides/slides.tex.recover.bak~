\note{It is well documented that US MP has worldwide effects. In particular, it influences different asset prices like stocks, exchange rates and yields of bonds issued in F and LCs.}
\note{There is a large literature that studies the spillovers of US MP.}
\note{In the paper, I revisit those spillovers but focusing on the components of the sovereign bond yields of EM in LC. This category is relevant given that more than 80\% of their sovereign debt is issued in LC.}
\note{Understanding the transmission channels can help EM to mitigate any undesired effects of US MP.}
\note{To understand the transmission channels, previous work uses traditional decompositions of bond yields, which assume that the bonds are free of default risk.}
\note{This is reasonable assumption for bonds issued by AE but not for bonds issued by EM.}
%\note{You might start by talking about spillovers from U.S. monetary policy--evidence that they exist, why they are important... (but just some quick facts and/or references--don't get bogged down in a review of the literature).}

\note{The main research question that I address in the paper is: How does US MP transmit to the sovereign bond yields of EM?}
\note{To answer the question, I first propose a decomposition of the yields that explicitly takes into account the risk that EM might default on their LC debt. I then use the decomposition to empirically quantify the effects of US MP surprises on each component.}
%\note{To understand the transmission mechanisms of US MP to bond yields, one can decompose the yields and analyze the effect on each component.}
%\note{Traditional decompositions assume that the yields are free of default and they are then decomposed into AESR and TP.}
%\note{But the fact that there is credit risk in EM yields means that traditional decompositions are not suitable for EM.}
%\note{Reflecting an increase in credit risk, so ignoring it will have negative implications in the analysis.}
%\note{First, how to decompose EM yields taking into account credit risk.}
%\note{Better understanding of vulnerabilities in global financial system.}

\end{center}
\end{frame}
\note{In this figure, you can see a stylized two-part decomposition of bond yields. The YC shows the relationship b/w bond yields at different maturities. By assuming that the bonds are free of default risk, the yields can be decomposed into two parts: average expected future short rates and a term premium.}
\note{A shortcoming of past work is to use this two-part decomposition for the yields of EM because it ignores the fact that EMs do default.}

\end{frame}
\note{I propose a three-part decomposition for the sovereign bond yields of EM.}
\note{You can see schematically that decomposition in this figure.}
\note{In addition to the usual two components, there is a third component that compensates investors for credit risk.}
\note{To explicitly account for credit risk, I use synthetic yields, which essentially swap the US YC into a LC YC that can be considered free of credit risk, so traditional decompositions can be applied to them. The spread between the actual and the synthetic yields is the credit risk compensation.}

%	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
\note{There are three main findings that summarize the transmission channels of US MP to EM yields.}
\note{First, the response of EM yields is economically significant and amplifies over the month following a MP surprise, which can be attributed to a portfolio rebalancing channel and slow-moving capital.} %  This is consistent with the evidence for advanced economies, since their yields display a similar sluggish response.
\note{I also find that, for certain types of surprises, the effects on EM yields last longer than on US yields.}

\note{The second result is that all 3 components of EM yields react, which means that surprises in US MP lead to a reassessment of policy rate expectations and a repricing of interest and credit risks in EM.}
\note{For instance, I find that investors expect CBs in EM to follow the monetary stance of the Federal Reserve rather than counteract its measaures. So if the Fed loosens or tightens financial conditions, EM CBs are expected to follow suit.}
\note{In addition, the UMP tools aimed at reducing the TP in US yields also reduce the TP in EM yields.}
\note{Moreover, the credit risk compensation part also reacts to US MP surprises. The fiscal implications in EM of MP in the US have so far not been discussed in the literature.}

\note{The third result is that since the 2007-2009 crisis the GFCy -which refers to the global comovement of risky asset prices- has a stronger impact at the long end of the YCs of EM, which limits the influence their CBs exert over their domestic YCs.}

\note{The paper relates to different branches in the literature.}
\note{In the interest of time, I will just point out two things. That the literature on term structures of EM yields has not examined credit risk systematically, it uses a two-part decomposition, so it implicitly treats EM as AE.}
\note{Second, the analysis of spillovers using yield decompositions has mainly focused on AE and, again, when EM are included, they are treated as AE.}


\section{Yield Curves}
\note{Are there any questions? Let me first explain how to construct the YCs that later will be decomposed.}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Nominal Yield Curves}

	 Bloomberg par yield curves \(\rightarrow\) Zero-coupon yield curves (\(\yLCnom\))
	\begin{itemize}
		\item But \alert{credit risk} in \(\yLCnom\) %LC nominal yields of EM
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textbf{Approach}: \alert{Synthetic} LC yields (\(\yLCsynt\)) as \textit{free of credit risk}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Swap U.S. Treasury yields into LC yields using currency derivatives
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textbf{Assumption}: Frictionless financial markets \citep{DuSchreger:2016JoF}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Arbitrageurs have access to U.S. and LC bonds
		\item Derivatives have no counterparty risk
		\item U.S. yields are free of default risk
	\end{itemize}
	
%	Why not CDS (credit default swaps)?
\end{frame}
\note{The nominal YCs are obtained from Bloomberg but, as I mentioned in the introduction, these yields have credit risk embedded in them.}
\note{To explicitly account for credit risk, I use synthetic yields, which essentially swap the US YC into a LC YC. In this sense, the US YC serves as a benchmark for all EMs. The construction of the synthetic yields uses currency derivatives.}
\note{This approach assumes frictionless financial markets, that is....}
\note{There are circumstances in which these assumptions migh not hold exactly.
	In the analysis, I rely on the work of \cite{DuSchreger:2016JoF} that shows that these assumptions are a \alert{useful benchmark} to study credit risk in EM yields.}

\note{An alternative approach to synthetic yields is to use CDS. I do not use them mainly because the definition of default is not always clear. Plus, ISDA does not include defaults on LC bonds governed under domestic law as triggers of CDS payouts.}
%\note{CDS do not adequately characterize LC credit risk.}
%\note{Broad perspective on credit risk, i.e. not receiving promised payments: EMs can change the law + Suspension of currency convertibility + Capital controls + Actual default.}
%\note{BFV curves are par yield curves provided by Bloomberg on a daily basis for different maturities. To obtain the implied zero-coupon curves, the yields are converted into discount factors, which are then used to estimate the parameters of the Nelson-Siegel-Svensson model.}
%\note{CDS is a financial derivative that enable investors to swap credit risk.}

\end{frame}
\note{Synthetic yields are constructed by adding a FX forward premium to US yields.}
\note{This FP compensates investors for the expected depreciation of the LC.}
\note{For maturities of less than one year, FP is calculated as the annualized difference between the forward and the spot exchange rates.}
\note{For maturities greater or equal to one year, FP is calculated using cross-currency swaps because outright forwards are less liquid.}
\note{When XCS are not directly traded in the market, they can be constructed using CCS and IRS.}
\note{All these instruments are liquid and collateralized so the bilateral counterparty risk is small.}
\note{Notice that the nominal YC is not needed in the construction of the synthetic YC.}

%\note{Today I can lock in a risk-free investment in LC by exchanging LC for USD, investing those USD in Tresuaries and enter into a forward contract agreeing to sell USD for LC in the future. Once I receive the payment from Treasuries, I exchange it back into LC.}

\note{The spread b/w LCNOM and LCSYNT yields measures deviations from CIP in government yields.}
\note{But the interpreation of the spread depends on the context.}
\note{For AE, Du, Im and Schreger document that the spread measures the convenience yield relative to US Treasuries.}
\note{For EM, Du and Schreger document that the spread captures the compensation for credit risk. In particular, they show that the spread for EM is highly correlated with their CDS.}
\note{While previous literature only focuses on the spread, I emphasize the importance of the synthetic yields b/c they can be considered as free of credit risk and so the traditional two-part decomposition can be applied to them.}
%\note{Correlation b/w CIP dev and CDS is high for EMs but not for AEs.}

\note{I construct nominal and synthetic yields for the 15 EMs originally studied by Du and Schreger at the daily frequency going back to 2000 up to 2019.}
\note{Starting dates vary by country. Longer series are desirable to pin down TP since it is an unobserved variable. But there are at least 10 years of data for most countries in the sample, which is a reasonable sample size for the estimation of the types of model that I will explain in a moment.}
\note{The maturities considered are 3M, 6M and from 1 to 10Y.}
\note{The construction of the synthetic yields uses the dataset built by GSW, which captures the USYC reasonably well for maturities greater or equal than 1Y.}
\note{For 3M and 6M yields I use data from CRSP, which is more robust at the short end.}

		\item Assumes default-free bonds \(\rightarrow\) \alert{Synthetic} yields (\(\yLCsynt\)) for EM

	\end{itemize}
	
	Intuition:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Yields driven by pricing factors \(\Xvars\)
		\item Dynamics of pricing factors (\(\Pmeasure\) and \(\Qmeasure\) measures)
		\item No-arbitrage restrictions ensure consistency % in cross section / time series of yields
%		\item Yields are affine functions of the pricing factors

		\hyperlink{SvyAugModel}{\beamergotobutton{Augmented Version}}
	\end{textblock*}
\end{frame}
\note{I use a discrete-time nominal ATSM, which is a standard tool to estimate the dynamics of risk-free \alert{nominal} yield curves.}
\note{As I mentioned earlier, the risk-free assumption is reasonable for bonds issued by AE.}
\note{In the case of EM, I use the model to capture the dynamics of synthetic yields b/c they are better aligned with the risk-free assumption than the nominal yields.}
\note{I augment the model with survey forecasts of future short-term interest rates to obtain robust decompositions as I will explain in a moment.}
\note{In the interest of time, I will not go into the details of the model but I will explain the intuition behind it.}
\note{Bond yields are driven by a set of pricing factors whose actual dynamics are represented with simple vector autoregressions. Restrictions are then imposed to reflect the no-arbitrage assumption across maturities, giving rise to alternative, risk-adjusted dynamics for yields. The differences between the actual and the risk-adjusted dynamics -also known as the P and the Q measures- reflect market participants' risk preferences. By exploiting these two dynamics, it is possible to decompose yields into expectations of future interest rates and term premia.}
%\note{The coefficients are functions of the maturity of the bond and the coefficients that determine the stochastic processes that drive the state variables.}

\note{The yields are decomposed as follows.}
\note{The fitted synthetic yields are given as affine functions of the pricing factors using parameters under the Q measure. The average expected future short rates are also affine functions but under the P measure. The difference b/w the two gives an estimate for the TP. Finally, the spread b/w the nominal and the fitted synthetic yields is the CRC.}
\note{Since the model fits the synthetic yields reasonably well as I will show you in a moment, this spread is largely the same as the one reported by Du and Schreger.}
\note{Of course, the spread is not be a perfect measure of credit risk but it is definitely better than ignoring it.}
\note{Notice that by decomposing the synthetic yields into two parts (YP and TP), I am at the same time decomposing the nominal yields into 3 parts.} %The third component being the credit risk compensation.

%\end{frame}
%\note{The estimation of the parameters in the model only requires data on yields, which accurately identifies the parameters under the Q measure.}
%\note{The parameters under the P measure, however, are poorly identified since bond yields are persistent, which results in unstable yield decompositions.}

\note{Surveys provide robust decompositions for the US and the UK YCs. They help anchoring the long run mean of interest rates.}
\note{Unfortunately, there is no data...}
\note{So I infer the forecasts from existing data using the Fisher equation and treating EMs as SOEs, which implies that the global real interest rate is determined abroad.}
\note{This approach requires forecasts for inflation in each EM and for the global real interest rate.}
\note{Inflation forecasts come from CE and are available twice a year.}
\note{The U.S. real interest rate serves as a proxy for the global real interest rate and is derived using forecasts for the T-bill rate and CPI inflation from SPF.}
\note{This is done using 5Y ahead forecasts and b/w 5Y and 10Y ahead forecasts.}
%\note{I compare them also against the real yields from TIPS and against an alternative approach using Taylor-rule type regressions, which also use forecasts for real GDP. The results are also comparable.}

\note{I estimate the model using end-of-month data and a two-step approach.}
\note{First, the model is estimated by MLE using only data on yields following the JSZ normalization. The estimated parameters are used as initial values in the second step.}
\note{Since surveys are available twice a year, they are treated as mising in non-release dates so the survey-augmented model is estimated by KF b/c it can easily handle missing data.}
\note{Surveys contain useful information that helps anchoring the model to reality in each country but they are not a panacea, so they are treated as `noisy' measures of expectations by using a conservative value of 75 bp for their standard devaition.}
\note{Finally, I use the parameters obtained with monthly data to estimate the pricing factors at the daily frequency. This allows me to decompose the yields at the daily frequency, which is needed to analyze the spillovers of US MP.}
%\note{At the daily frequency there is noise in yield data that can undermine the estimation.}

\note{The solid blue line is... The dash-dotted orange line is... And the dashed yellow line is...}
\note{On average, ESR explains most of the variability in yields.}
\note{Nevertheless, the dynamics of TP and CRC are also important drivers of EM bond yields.}
\note{Notice that the TP plays a relatively bigger role than CRC, in general.}
\note{Also, the decomposition captures local conditions in each country.}
\note{For instance, the CRC for HUF increased after 2010, when the current populist government came into power.}
\note{In the case of MX, the CB started a tightening cycle following the 2016 US presidential election, in response to a depreciation of the currency. That move is reflected in an increase in ESR.}
\note{To asses the decomposition, I study the components separately but focusing on the ESR and the TP b/c D-S already study the CRC in detail; in particular, they show that it is highly correlated with CDS.}

%\note{There is a downward trend in EM TP, which consistent w/ the evidence for AE.}
%\note{Since 2011 there has been strong demand for LC bonds in Asia, which partly explains TP < 0 seen in Asian countries.}

%\note{USTP increased around the onset of the Great Recession (September 2008), the taper tantrum (June 2013), and the 2016 U.S. presidential election (November 2016), while it declined after the first unexpected announcement of the QE program by the Fed (March 2009).}
%\note{Common explanations for the decline in the USTP include an increased demand of U.S. assets by global investors and the effects of the UMP of the Fed.}
%\note{Explanation for change in sign (Campbell, Sunderam \& Viceira (2016)): TP < 0 is explained by the flip in the sign of the correlation between stocks and bonds -bonds hedge stocks-.}

\note{Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the relationship between the TP and inflation uncertainty is particularly relevant in EM.}
\note{To test this hypothesis, I regress the TP on a measure of inflation uncertainty controlling for the business cycle, which is proxied by the growth rate in real GDP.}
\note{Following Wright, the measure of inflation uncertainty is the STD of the permanent component of inflation based on the unobserved components stochastic volatility (UCSV) model of Stock and Watson.}

\end{itemize}

EM \alert{monetary autonomy} declines along yield curve \citep{Obstfeld:2015}
\end{frame}
\note{One the three main findings that I mentioned in the introduction is related to the GFCy, which refers to fluctuations in financial activity on a global scale and is mainly driven by developments in the US.}
\note{The literature describes different mechanisms that I referred to as the YC channel, which can be explained as follows.}
\note{It has been argued that LT yields are more influced by global forces than ST ones.}
\note{In particular, since UMPs implemented by CBs in AE aim to influence LT yields, those policies can also affect EM yields through the TP and they can even have risk spillovers that particularly influence ST yields.}
\note{These developments limit the monetary autonomy of the CBs in EM along their YCs.}

%\note{We usually think that CBs exert control over a ST interest rate and financial markets transmit the monetary stance to LT interest rates.}

\note{If there is a YC channel, we should observe that LT yields are more correlated than ST ones.}
\note{Also, there should be a direct relationship that varies by maturity b/w the TP in the US and in EM, and b/w ESR in the US and in EM.}
\note{If there are risk spillovers, we should observe that the US TP influences the ESR particularly at the short end.}

\note{First, notice that the response of ESR to the local policy rate is stronger at ST than at LT. Also, ESR is associated with its US counterpart only at the LT -> This evidence shows that the monetary autonomy in EM is stronger at the ST than at LT.}

\note{The second point is that the response of TP in EM to the US TP increases with maturity. Also, the TP in EM is positively associated with the Vix only at LT -> This shows that the GFCy (represented by the US TP and the VIX) is more relevant for LT yields than for ST ones.}

\note{The last point is that there are risk spillovers to the ESR in EM from the USTP but not from the VIX. Those risk spillovers are stronger at the ST than LT as suggested by Kalemli-Ozkan.}

\note{All these results are in line with the implications of the YC channel.}
%\note{Higher TP during recessions: high UNE, low IP. Evidence of EM TP countercyclical.}
%\note{INF erodes value of nominal bonds: in periods of rising INF demand a higher TP.}
%\note{Higher TP due to FX depreciation in line with risk-taking channel of FX.
%	Currency depreciation tightens financial conditions, higher sovereign bond spreads.}
%\note{Effect of the domestic variables in line with findings for AEs. 
%	Investors demand a higher term premium during recessions, when the unemployment rate increases. This shows evidence of a countercyclical behavior of the TP in EMs.
%	The positive effect of inflation on the TP conforms with the idea that inflation erodes the value of nominal bonds and so in periods of rising inflation investors demand a higher TP.}
%\note{A depreciation of the LC is associated with an increase in the TP. This seems counterintuitive since EMs are usually commodity exporters so it appears to contradict the standard trade-channel effect. 
%	However, it is in line with the risk-taking channel of exchange rates found by \cite{HofmannShimShin:2017}, according to which currency depreciation is associated with tighter financial conditions and increased sovereign bond spreads.}

\note{After the GFC, the effect of a FG easing surprise lasts less in EM LT yields than in US yields, which widens the nominal-synthetic spread in EM at LT.} %makes investors relatively more willing to invest in LT bonds in the US than in EM
\note{The figure also shows that FG surprises aimed at reducing the LT USTP also reduce the LT TP in EM.}
\note{Note that following the surprise, the TP and the CRC at LT move in opposite directions. Almost offsetting each other. This is where accounting for CR pays off b/c if CR were to be ignored, one would conclude that FG does not affect the TP in EM.}
\note{In relation to the YC channel, a FG easing surprise also reduces the expectations of policy rates in EM at ST in line with the risk spillover mechanism.}

\note{An asset purchase easing surprise flattens both US and EM YCs since the effects are stronger on LT yields than on ST ones. The effects of an LSAP surpise last longer on EM yields than on US yields.}
\note{Unlike with FG, an LSAP surprise incentivizes investors to invest in LT yields in EM, reducing TP and CRC.}
\note{The on impact increase in the CRC at LT is more a reflection of the response in the US Treasuries market than on the bond markets in EM.}
\note{Similar to the responses to a FG easing surprise post-GFC, the responses of the 10Y TP and the 2Y ESR are also consistent with the YC channel.}
\note{So there is evidence of a YC channel of UMPs.}

\frametitle{Conclusions}

\textbf{Three}-part decomposition of EM sovereign yields
\begin{itemize}
\item Average expected short rates \item Term premium \item \alert{Credit risk} compensation
\end{itemize}

U.S. monetary policy \textbf{spillovers} to EM sovereign yields
\begin{enumerate}
\item Responses are economically \alert{significant} yet \alert{delayed}
\item Reassessment of policy rate expectations and repricing of \alert{risks}
\item Evidence of a \alert{yield curve channel} since 2008
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
\note{I propose a 3-part decomposition of EM sovereign yields that explicitly takes into account the risk that EM might default in LC debt.}
\note{I then use this decomposition to understand the transmission channels of US MP. I find that...}
\note{These results have implications for both AE and EM.}
%\note{These results give rise to further research questions like, for example, what tools do CBs in EM have at their disposal to deal with MP spillovers from abroad.}
%\note{Extensions: nominal-real decompositions, jumps.}
%\note{YC channel: EM monetary autonomy decreases along the yield curve and involves the CRC.}

\note{YCs exhibit standard properties such as an upward slope.}
\note{In general interest rates in EM are higher than in AE, the table reflects that.}

\note{For instance, the level and the volatility of EM curves are larger than those of AE.} 
\note{Also, the short end of their curves is more volatile than the long end, particularly so for the synthetic curve.}
\note{Higher volatility at ST makes the model's fit at ST harder. Don't affect the results b/c the analysis focuses on the 2Y and 10Y.}
