Potential questions:
What countries are in the S&P chart (AEs and EMs)?
How liquid are the CCS used?




Idea:
Default-free estimates of TP for EMs
What is the TP

Motivation:
Much TP work done for AEs, none for EMs

Why is it important:
Uses of TP in advanced economies
Type of questions that can be answered once having TP estimates

Overview of estimating TPs:
Default-free LC yield curve, idea from Du & Schreger
ATSM
TP estimates

Findings:
Comparison with US TP
Relation with macroeconomic and financial variables (economic stories about TP behavior)
Relation with LC credit spread
How useful is the default-risk adjustment

Current work:
Given the potential for small sample problems, using survey data on forecasts to discipline the model

Work ahead:
Refine TP estimation
Multiple models to see robustness
FC yield curve
FX and UIP
Effects of US and local MP
Multi-country ATSM
Comparing EMs with AEs SOE (Australia, NZ, Canada)

Conclusions
